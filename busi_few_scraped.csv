But there is no other community that fully embodies what the term stands for than the Gujaratis.

After being diagnosed with autoimmune disease and being disappointed by doctor after doctor, Dara Jones set off on a mission to recover her health with real food. In the footsteps of Robyn O’Brien, author of The Unhealthy Truth, Dara takes you on her journey through Monsanto’s world of GMO foods.  After reading it, you’ll be empowered to take the reins of your own health and will never look at your grocery store shelves the same way.  In this personal account of her ongoing health recovery from autoimmune thyroid and Lyme disease, Foreign Invaders takes a practical look at the role of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the healing process.  How does a veteran of the business world and scientific layperson sort through the controversy and hysteria surrounding genetically modified foods?  Are they helpful or harmful when trying to bring the immune system back into balance?  Do they add or subtract from the body’s toxic burden?  Are GMOs friend or foe to the chronically ill? Foreign invader or familiar and recognizable?  The stakes are high.  There are currently 100 different autoimmune diseases identified including type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, Graves disease, Hashitomotos and lupus.  50 million Americans, or 1 in 5, have one of these diseases and 75 percent are women.  Autoimmune disease is now one of the top 10 leading causes of death of women under the age of 65.  It is responsible for more than $100 billion in direct health care costs annually in the US.   In this engaging, honest and informative work, the determined and pragmatic author presents her experience navigating the healthcare system, research into what constitutes a healing diet and conclusions about consuming genetically modified foods.  Topics covered include autoimmune disease, inflammation, food intolerance and food allergies, the health risks and food safety issues of GMOs, the process of creating genetically engineered food, the impact of pesticides on the immune system and a brief discussion of sustainability, environmental and social justice issues. If you’ve been diagnosed with a chronic illness, autoimmune disorder or Lyme Disease, grab a copy of this book today."

If you want to make the most out of your life, developing this kind of mind is essential.The big challenge in achieving this goal is being in a culture that glorifies amount of work done rather than high quality work. Most low-level jobs, where young adults are hired, require very little creativity and critical thinking. This creates a culture of taking shortcuts to achieve objectives that we are not really passionate about.Because of the advancement of consumer electronic technology, we are surrounded by distractions that are constantly craving engagement. The engagement we give these distractions is taking away our ability to focus on the things that really matter. If we could just spend less time tapping our smart phones, we could do a whole lot more with our waking hours.Indulging in these distractions also promotes the practice of constantly switching attentions. This habit kills our ability to focus. People who have this kind of habit often become uncomfortable when doing one thing for a long period of time. They lack the ability to continue working, especially if the task is very boring.Luckily, there are ways to rehabilitate our ability to focus. We can enhance our minds and condition them to be ready for tasks that require prolonged attention. However, we need to develop habits and practice some exercises to be able to accomplish this. This book provides you with these habits and the exercises. They will help you develop a mind capable to concentrating for longer periods of time. There is no ultimate technique that will work for everyone. That is why we provide you with 25 techniques. If the first tip will not work for you, you still have 24 chances to improve your focus. Begin working on your ability to concentrate today."

16,B00IB3ZXQY,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IB3ZXQY,Find Money Every Day (The Essence of Money Series Book 2),4.97,"Can you really find money every day? Yes! There are three ways. 1. Increase your income. 2. Decrease your expenses. 3. Manifest it. Oh, good. You’re still here. Sometimes, I say, “manifest it” to people and their reaction is to roll their eyes, cover their ears, and sing “la, la, la.” (Actually, no one has sang la, la, la … yet.) The first time I tried to manifest it I found money every day for 46 days in a row even though I only used the techniques for 30 days. Usually, I found dimes, quarters, ones, and twenties. However, on day 34, I found $213.34. You can learn how to do this. In fact, if you put your mind to these ideas, you’ll start finding money immediately. You learn by doing. You know the old saying, “I’ll believe it when I see it.” You have it backwards. You’ll see it when you believe it so you’ll take small steps at first. If you want to manifest $20,000 and you've never manifested $20, you need to learn that first. If you have never manifested $20, you need to learn how to manifest $1 first. This book doesn't teach you how to get rich quick. Nor, will it teach how to budget. It teaches you how to manifest money by first finding money every day!Here is something interesting. I can read minds (maybe). When I mentioned manifesting money, did you think, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, if I don’t spend a dollar, it’s like making a dollar?” That’s true but it isn't manifesting. As you’ll see when you read my story, it is possible to make money appear. It is not magic. In this book, you learn some obvious things that you should know, some not very obvious things that you probably don’t know, and some things that just aren't obvious so you probably don’t know them. Whew, that’s a mouthful! You are a sensible, reasonable person. You know money doesn't grow on trees. It’s just made out of trees. You also know that money doesn't just appear out of nowhere. Or, does it? Let me tell you my story."

Over the past 30 years, great technological leaps failed to translate into faster growth, more jobs, or rising incomes. The link between innovation and broad prosperity seems to have broken down.At the heart of the problem is a great migration. Families are fleeing the country's richest cities in droves, leaving places like San Francisco and Boston for the great expanse of the Sunbelt, where homes are cheap, but wages are low.In The Gated City, Ryan Avent, The Economist's economics correspondent, diagnoses a critical misfiring in the American economic machine. America's most innovative cities have become playgrounds for the rich, repelling a cost-conscious middle class and helping to concentrate American wealth in the hands of a few. Until these cities can provide a high quality of life to average households, American economic stagnation will continue."

For those of us directly involved in this research of the human brain, it is a very exciting time.   However, very few people outside of the neuroscience community understand these discoveries well enough to take advantage of them or apply them to their own lives in a way that gets meaningful results.   I see a need for simple, clear, accessible explanations of how to apply brain-based practices to greatly improve how we work and conduct business, so that everyone can benefit from use these discoveries. A few years ago, I was invited to write a series of articles for publication, with exactly that goal. This book is a collection of those articles.  In addition to being supported by recent research of the human brain in the Western world, the articles in this book are also influenced by my knowledge of mindfulness and other ancient practices from the Eastern world. Interestingly, much of the recent neuroscience research confirms that many of these ancient Eastern practices do result in greatly improved brain functioning. The East-West synthesis evident in these articles reflects my many years of work and study on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, and my lifelong interest in how to improve the human brain."

50,B00HOLI87U,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HOLI87U,Inbox Freedom: The Zen Master’s Guide to Tackling Your Email and Work,9.99,"Inbox Freedom is the first productivity and efficiency system designed from the ground up to deal with the demands of the modern workplace. The authors of this book are two Silicon Valley technology executives who have spent countless hours refining their own productivity systems to deal with the ever-increasing demands on their time. Both felt that the most popular books on organization and time management had some good principles but didn’t reflect the modern world of work.In the past decade, the pace of change has accelerated. The emergence of powerful smartphones, tablet computers, and cloud computing services has led to a tremendous increase in connectivity and communication at work. As a consequence, many of us feel overwhelmed by the demands on our time. The volume of emails, text messages, documents, and other work-related communication continues to grow but our notions of productivity and efficiency are still rooted in a world that was dominated by the phone, fax machine, and printed paper. Most of the seminal works in organization, time management, and productivity where written before the rise of mobile computing, smartphones, and cloud computing. While many of those works had strong tips for coping with a world dominated by paper and printed work, the world of work has changed substantially. All of us are expected to produce and share more written work in digital form than ever. The modern professional faces an almost unsurmountable number of challenges, including the following:-The “always on” culture enabled by smartphones, tablets and ubiquitous access to data on the go creates the expectation of 24x7 availability and productivity.-People are expected to stay on top of an ever-increasing volume of email with limited tools for prioritizing and filtering incoming messages.-As the number of important tasks competing for your attention continues to grow, the pressure to make sure you’re working on the right task at the right time continues to increase.Inbox Freedom will give you a framework for thinking about how to approach your work so that you can be more focused at work and less anxious about the things that aren’t getting done. Inbox Freedom will give you the tools to think about how you deal with the four core aspects of most people’s work - email, tasks, documents, and notes - and to build a system that will help you become much more effective at work and in life. For many, managing email is the biggest challenge at work. That is not surprising to us. While many of us learned to read in elementary school and were taught to write effectively in high school and college, the modern workplace does little to help people become more effective or be thoughtful on how to structure their work. We devote a significant portion of the book to helping your benchmark your current mastery of email management and providing specific tactics and tips you can use to improve. The other key theme in the book is the importance of maximizing what you can do with the combination of your smartphone and cloud computing. We believe that the emergence of the smartphone connected to cloud computing resources is one of the most important developments in the world of work and most people are not taking advantage of what that combination allows. Inbox Freedom is designed to be a fast read with lots of specific tips and tactics you can use to become more effective and productive immediately. Highlights of the book include:Specific tips and tricks for increasing your ability to manage email in less timeA comprehensive list of cloud-based tools and apps you can use to double your productivityTwo productivity audits that will benchmark your current mastery of email and your smartphone, with specific tips and advice for how to improveInbox Freedom is approximately 100 pages in length and is available exclusively on the Kindle."

Originally a military text of stratagem, The Art of War has influenced military and political leaders throughout the centuries. His ideas still hold true today and are highly applicable to the modern-day battleground...corporations.Organizations have a collective psychology and oftentimes an underlying psychosis. Despite nearly 100 years of effort to make management a science, starting with Frederick Taylor in the early 1900s, organizations today are still composed of individuals and their feelings. Even though decisions that are made in everyday business are supposedly rooted in logic and rational thought, almost all decisions are ultimately judgments, and just like all of human behavior, those judgments are based on the individual's mood, feelings, and thoughts.This volume is to be consumed in small chunks, and highlights 21 of Sun Tzu's most applicable strategies. It is aimed toward helping the individual to become a master of his or her surroundings, situations, and adversaries in a corporate environment.This volume applies ancient philosophy to modern-day situations and highlights how we can influence the behavior of others by creating the environment we want, tapping into the feelings and thoughts of others, and ultimately impacting leadership judgments.Some may call it manipulation, some may call it deception. I call it the Art of Modern War."

A trend may appear strong, while below the surface it may be weak and ready to reverse.This book will teach you to use indicators for measuring the internal power of trends.  When they confirm an uptrend, they tell you it’s OK to hold or add to long positions.  At other times they signal that the trend is suspect: it is better to exit, take profits, and even consider switching from long to short or vice versa.A divergence is a disagreement between the patterns of indicators and prices.  You’ll find bullish divergences near market bottoms and bearish divergences near market tops.  Some traders use these important terms loosely – this book will make them very clear by guiding you through several Reader Exercises.

It's up to you make your life matter in the only way you can: by doing things that make a difference to you, to those around you, and to those whose lives you touch. Time is short. You have exactly NOW to do whatever it is you're here to do, or to let the inexorable passage of hours and days and years kill your potential like fruit left to die on a vine. The universe doesn’t hate you, but it doesn’t love you, either. You’re just an atom in its infinite workings. The universe doesn’t care if you live, die, suffer, or thrive. Whatever your life here will mean is up to you. Stop worrying so much about what others think and start being who you're supposed to be. It's time to do some epic shit."

As a result, they never know where they're going - and they end up taking too many dead-end trails that lead to nowhere because theynever understood they had the right and the ability to choose theirPoint B.Too many folks procrastinate even the micro-decisions that affecttheir life path. As a result, they are frozen by indecisiveness when itcomes to the big decisions because they never take responsibility fordefining their own Point B.Too many folks consider two weeks to be long term planning. As aresult, they end up making reflex decisions that get them off the rightpath because they never defined their right Point B past a two-weektimeline.If you are already in a long-term relationship, you and yoursignificant-other need to have a similar desired Point B destination and a shared path to reach it.If you don't share the same Point B, at some other point your pathswill probably go different directions - with the result that each of you may end up going your separate ways.You and your career goals need to have a similar desired Point Bdestination. If you are even considering starting a company, your veryfirst decision needs to be your definition of the right-for-you personal Point B.

110,B005Q134YM,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005Q134YM,How To Win Good to Great Friends With Seven Habits and In One Minute Learn The Secret To Think and Grow Rich,3.99,"Hi, I’m Tom Nardone, a happy, fun, successful, and occasionally famous guy. Over the last 15 years I’ve read a lot of time management, business, and self-help books. Now, like a mother bird chews up, partially digests and spits up worms for her young, I am regurgitating all of that information. That is where I got the title for this book. I mashed all of the best-selling book names into one exhaustingly long book title. I’m sure it will google well. Here Are Some Excerpts From The Book:Good To Great by Jim Collins: Mr. Collins has a buzz phrase “Good is the opposite of Great” and he is probably correct. When a company is good, people get complacent, they think that what they do, what they have always done, is enough, but they are wrong. Continuous improvement is required to be great and “good” companies just aren’t that good at improving. There is a simple wisdom in (one of the principle concepts of the book) The Hedgehog Concept. Great Companies find one thing they can do better than anyone else in the world, they do it well, and they don’t get distracted. I used this in my own company and it worked. Thanks Jim Collins.The Secret by Rhonda Byrne: The secret takes 198 pages to tell you that if you think positively and you really want something badly enough, the universe will bring it to you. I find this partially to be a load of crap. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey: Learning the seven habits will help you, it helped me. If you don’t want to read Covey’s entire book, read mine. I summarize each of the seven habits and what they mean to me. Awaken The Giant Within by Tony Robbins: This book takes 540 pages to tell you what you could learn by googling “Neuro-Linguistic Programming” Essentially, the words you say to yourself, aloud or in your own mind, are powerful. You got that? Saying bad things can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, start saying nice things to yourself as well as using positive visualization and you’ll become more successful. How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie: On a good day I remember and practice a few of Carnegie’s principles. On a bad day, I’m a jerk and I forget them all. This book changed my life and after reading it I slowly migrated from a complete asshole to an OK person to be around. In my book I quickly walk you through the steps and principles that Carnegie created.Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter: Fame is fleeting and so was this book. The complete implosion of the real estate market flushed Kiyosaki’s theory right down the toilet. The One Minute Manager by Ken Blanchard: A great management book that anyone can use. Written in parable style to make it easy to digest, this book makes a ton of sense and it has stuck with me.Think And Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill: Andrew Carnegie, at the time the world’s wealthiest man, hires a learned friend, Napoleon Hill, to go around for twenty freaking years and talk to a bunch of incredibly successful people and then summarize the reasons for their success. Hill meets and studies people you might have heard about. They have last names like: Ford, Edison, Wright, Roosevelt, Wilson, Schwab, Eastman, Woolworth, Taft, and Graham-Bell. He gathers all of this information and then proceeds to slim it down to 13 principles. By doing so, he created one of the greatest pieces of personal motivation ever. Conclusion: Buy my book if you are looking for the best of the best personal motivation. I hope you will enjoy it."

128,B009P2GY54,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009P2GY54,How to Budget for the Holidays,2.99,"That well-known time of the year known as “the holidays” begins in late October (if you wish to count Halloween) and ends around January 2 (if you celebrate New Year’s Day). It isn’t a term you will see on a wall calendar with a big “Holidays Begin” in bold letters, and it means something slightly different for everyone, but we all know what it means to us. For some it means strictly religious observance or celebration. Others think of it as time spent with family and friends. Still more people view it as a time of year to think of those in need, and soup kitchens and blood drives get an annual boost from all the giving.Regardless of exactly what the holidays mean to you, they probably mean spending. Whether you spend on traditional meals or on gifts for everyone or on outfits for a variety of functions that require your attendance, there can be ignoring the fact that starting in early November, we start to feel anxious about our wallets.These two things – the traditions that bring warmth into our lives and the holiday spending – don’t have to cancel each other out. It is easy to forget the good feelings that go along with sharing time with family when we are worried about making ends meet. That is why we need to think about doing the holidays on a budget. If we can control our spending amidst all of the lights and gift wrap and cookies, then we can more thoroughly enjoy the entire experience of the holidays.Rather than a specific plan laid out for budgeting, this book encourages you to find a budget (with a few tips about how) and cut back on what you usually spend in the fall and winter. It demonstrates a variety of ways to do this: by finding inexpensive solutions, by rethinking how we approach the holidays, and by reevaluating what real giving is. You might find you don’t connect with all of the ideas here, but some are sure to appeal to you. Even if you only shake off some of the anxiety the holidays bring, you will find a more peaceful holiday season. No Bah Humbug about it."

You got on Twitter and tried to sell your books, but nothing happened. You searched for readers, but just kept attracting spam.

But, simply broadcasting your link isn’t going to get you the attention you need. This concise guide doesn’t focus on the nuts and bolts of Twitter.

142,B0051GU06W,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051GU06W,"Inflation Investing: A Guide for the 2010s, Volume 1 (Essentials for Creating a Portfolio)",9.95,"If you’re like many investors, you thought that inflation was on its way to becoming a serious problem in 2008. Gold hit a $1000 an ounce, up from a low around $250 earlier in the decade. Oil reached almost a $150 a barrel, well above its previous high around $40. Despite soaring commodity prices, government inflation figures however somehow indicated inflation was barely elevated. And then the Credit Crisis came along and commodity prices collapsed along with the global economy. The major economies then began the biggest global money-printing spree in history. While this has always led to massive inflation since the days of the Roman Empire, the monetary authorities claimed things would be different this time (they never are). By 2011, gold, the ultimate inflation barometer, was almost $2000 an ounce, silver broke through its previous high of $21 and almost hit $50 an ounce, copper hit a new all-time high and cotton broke a peak price that had held for a 150-years. Global food prices reached a new record high. The unfolding inflation story was correctly and accurately predicted by author Montgomery at the meetings of the New York Investing meetup, a group of over 3000 independent investors that provides the public with independent, unbiased investing education and in his blog the ‘Helicopter Economics Investing Guide’. People who paid attention made money, sometimes lots of money, while the average investor was struggling with the market. Dutch Radio cited the New York Investing meetup as the only group it found that got its members profitably through the Credit Crisis.The inflation around 2010 was only the beginning and it is likely it will continue throughout this decade and maybe even into the 2020s. The big opportunities in inflation investing are still ahead of us. Inflation Investing – A Comprehensive Guide for the 2000s provides the key to taking advantage of them. Readers will obtain a thorough knowledge and understanding of inflation and how to build a portfolio of appropriate assets. It shows how history demonstrates what the best inflation investing assets are – and that some of today’s popularly held beliefs about inflation are incorrect. The past also provides valuable clues about how inflation will develop in the 2000s. Similar events happen over and over again during inflationary eras and investors who are not prepared for them will find their portfolios are at risk. Inflation Investing – A Comprehensive Guide for the 2000s is a highly readable, engaging account that can benefit investors at all levels. Unlike other works, it combines historical analysis with practical easy to implement investing information. It doesn’t just discuss a few favored recommendations of the author, but is thorough in its coverage. It is also as up to date as possible, going way beyond the limited asset choices available in the 1970s. Volume 1 covers the broad-based analysis that all inflation investors should be familiar with along with how to create an appropriate portfolio. Volume II provides detailed descriptions of each major inflation-investing asset class along with specific investing possibilities."

The book was first published in 1937 during the Great Depression. At the time of Hill's death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold 20 million copies.  It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill's books - a perennial best-seller after 70 years (BusinessWeek Magazine's Best-Seller List ranked Think and Grow Rich as the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was first published). Think and Grow Rich is listed in John C. Maxwell's A Lifetime ""Must Read"" Books List.The text of Think and Grow Rich is founded on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, the result of more than twenty years of research based on Hill's close association with a large number of individuals who achieved great wealth during their lifetimes.At Andrew Carnegie's bidding, Hill studied the characteristics of these achievers and developed 16 ""laws"" of success intended to be applied by anybody to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich condenses these laws further and provides the reader with 13 principles in the form of a philosophy of personal achievement.Napoleon Hill (October 26, 1883 – November 8, 1970) was an American author who was one of the earliest producers of the modern genre of personal-success literature. He is widely considered to be one of the great writers on success. His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich (1937), is one of the best-selling books of all time (at the time of Hill's death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold 20 million copies). Hill's works examined the power of personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. He became an adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933-36. ""What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve"" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions. How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach of the average person, were the focal points of Hill's books."

165,B005YIR5WO,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005YIR5WO,Sell on TV: How to Market Your Product on TV and into Retail with the Power of Infomercials / DRTV,9.99,"Does your product have what it takes to become the next $100 million success like OxiClean, the Snuggie or Pillow Pets? This easy to follow book will guide you through the process from concepting to market research to in-market profits. ""Powered by the air you breathe, activated by the water that you and I drink,"" perhaps the pervasive Billy Mays' most infamous line, started a trend that would lead to billions of dollars in sales for OxiClean.  What started on TV, soon led to Wal-Mart, Target and virtually every other retailer on the planet.  Eventually, the company that launched OxiClean was sold by the Appel family for $325 million.  You'll hear more of the OxiClean story in Chapter 1.""It's a pillow.  It's a pet.  It's a Pillow Pet!""  If you have children between the ages of 2 and 10, it's likely that you've heard them singing this tagline a few times around the house.  You probably even have a Pillow Pet or two in your home. Jennifer Telfer, the inventor of the now famous Pillow Pet started selling the stuffed animal in malls in 2008 and quickly grew to $3 million in annual revenue.  Not a bad start for a first time inventor.  Two years later, in 2010, the Pillow Pets brand earned over $300 million in annual revenue, and it's still growing.  This is a great example of how an inventor with a simple idea can turn their product into immense profits through selling on TV. And, finally, who would believe that a blanket with sleeves would ever become a national phenomenon? But that's exactly what happened when the Snuggie was first introduced as a direct response commercial (infomercial) premiering in 2008. From there, the often-mocked--but wildly successful--product has been featured on the Today show and has grown to near cult-like status among its faithful followers. What do these wildly differing products all have in common? For one, they were all initially sold on TV; and each has made its individual creators or companies millions. Chances are if you're reading a book called Sell It On TV, you're at least vaguely familiar with pet rocks and Chia Pets, Mister Microphones, OxiClean, Pillow Pets and Snuggies, to say nothing of the Clapper, the Magic Jack, Ginsu knives and the PedEgg line of in-your-face commercials.  Jon LaClare is the founder of Harvest Growth, an infomercial and DRTV consulting firm (www.HarvestGrowth.com)."

If you are fed up with trading systems that promise the earth and fail to deliver then 'The 10XROI Trading System' will not disappoint. A leading foreign exchange broker conducted a study that found that winning traders had something in common. Their wins were much larger than their losses. Many trading systems are designed to have lots of wins but that doesn't make them profitable, they just appeal to the Holy Grail seeker who is looking for a trading system that never loses.    By trading high probability trading strategies that give a very large risk reward ratio like The 10XROI Trading system, you will automatically have a much higher chance of actually making a profit in the Forex markets. You may be an experienced trader who has already taken many trading courses or  you may be just trying to decide on the best trading system for your personality and life circumstances.    Written by a trader with over eight years’ experience in trading foreign currencies,gold and futures, this book is written in an easy to comprehend style with lots of illustrations and trading examples to help clarify each part of the system.    This trading strategy is simple and easy to follow and takes up a very small amount of time as it uses the daily and hourly time frames. Unlike most day trading systems this makes it easy to trade around most jobs. Most importantly it explains every part of the system including the correct trading psychology and money management which most systems leave out.The trader runs an active blog at http://10XROITradingSystem.com where questions about the system are promptly answered. (This book assumes some trading experience)(Recent Review)""""Ever heard the expression 'buy low, sell high'? Or how about 'let your winners run and cut your losses?' I especially like 'ensure your winners exceed your losses'. I just finished reading a book on the Quants whose mantra is to 'put the maths, or the odds on your side'. Oh and I love the Jesse Livermore quote ' It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.'  Great Sayings. Wonderful sayings. Fantastic. But my thinking: most retail strategies do not capture most, if any of these principles. So is there a methodology, that retail traders can use, even with limited funds, that captures all of this? And I mean all of this? I believe there is. LR has put together a strategy that does as the big boys do: focusses not on consistency of trades, but consistency of the trader using a simple,intuitive, market rhythmic approach. Of the strategy:Does it Buy low/Sell High? - Yes.Are Winners run, Losses cut? - Yes  Do Winners exceed Losers? - YesIs the Maths on your side? - YesDo you Wait for trades to come to you? - YesI have been trading the 10XROI strategy for just over a month now. The last two weeks of trading has seen me bag over 1000 pips. And yet that is not, I repeat NOT the focus or what impresses me. It is the rate of return. Each trade aims for a take profit of 10R and always a stop loss of 1R - which I have achieved. While it's still early days for me I already know the principles taught are the principles practiced and espoused by the world's foremost traders. There is no magic bullet. Just sound time tested principles focussed on patience, a simple strategy, money management and sound psychology. Why reinvent the wheel? Just spin that thing.""""Kevin"

193,B006JY45ZC,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006JY45ZC,The Long Depression: The Slump of 2008 to 2031 (Updated 2013 Edition),3.99,"When the credit crunch struck in 2008, finance ministers feared we were faced with a re-run of the Great Depression of the 1930s and rushed to pump money into the global economy. In this ground-breaking essay, the award-winning financial columnist Matthew Lynn argues that what we are going through is a re-run of the Long Depression, a slump that lasted from 1873 to 1896.  Three huge financial shocks have collided with each other: the ending of the great debt bubble, the demise of the dollar as a global reserve currency, and the slow motion car crash of the euro. Each on their own would hit the world economy hard. Taken together, it is the economic equivalent of having a heart attack, suffering a stroke, and then getting shot - all on the same morning. In this concise, stimulating essay, Matthew Lynn argues that as the global economy is rocked by these three financial earthquakes, it will experience a prolonged period of turbulence and volatility. And the slump will last as long as its nineteenth century predecessor. The 2013 edition has been expanded and updated to bring it up to date. Matthew Lynn is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal MarketWatch, for Money Week, and a regular contributor to The Spectator and The Sunday Times. His latest financial book ‘Bust: Greece, The Euro & The Sovereign Debt Crisis’ was short-listed for the Spear’s/Citbank Business Book of the Year award.His financial books have been widely praised. “Lynn’s book is fast-paced, entertaining and perceptive about the causes of the crisis.” – The Financial Times on Bust.""Public finance seldom makes for a juicy read. But Matthew Lynn turns central banking into a seesaw of ghastly revelations and roaring hilarity. Bust is solid macroeconomics, practical trade theory, and fiscal policy that anybody can understand.” – The Financial Post, Canada, on Bust.“An excellent primer on the euro crisis” – National Review. Endeavour Press is the UK's leading publisher of digital books."

A framed picture has disappeared from the men's room wall... the freezer is suddenly and explicably on the fritz... a man at the counter can't comprehend the cool cantaloupe soup... and the health inspector just walked through the door. Don't panic - it's just another day at Ambition Coffee House & Eatery. Business co-owner and author Marc Renson takes you on an entertaining, outrageous journey of madness and mayhem experienced in the daily operation of Ambition, one of downtown Schenectady, New York's most popular restaurants. Read about celebrities who eat there and meet ""the regulars"" who keep the staff hopping with their cosmic questions: Is the sandwich special good? Does your cream of tomato soup have milk in it? Will the Cajun spices bother me? And of course... is the coffee fresh?  And while you're at it, contemplate the question - Do crazy people really wear red shoes? The answer may have you glancing through your own closet. Interestingly enough, enduring the insanity of what people say and do results in an understanding that everything happens for a reason. There is a purpose for meeting all the people along life's journey, and they collectively contribute to the certain fact that there is an answer to ""why me""... it is because dreams really do come true, as they have for proprietor Marc Renson.  As Marc would say, ""Welcome to my world… and my ambition!"""

222,B00KC7ARM2,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KC7ARM2,"A Critique of Piketty's ""Capital in the Twenty-first Century""",3.99,"Sam Vaknin served as economic advisor to several governments and in various management functions in multinationals. He is the former UPI Senior Business Correspondent and the author of several books and numerous articles on topics in economics, business management, and finance.In his programmatic and data-laden tome, “Capital in the Twenty-first Century” (2014), Thomas Piketty makes several assertions, two of which merit a closer look: (1) That r (the return on capital) is, in the long-run always greater than g (the growth of the real economy), thus enriching the rich; and (2) that inherited wealth tends to create a “patrimonial” form of capitalism, akin to the aristocracy in the French and British ancient regimes.Putting aside the somewhat artificial and dubious distinction between the “real” and the financial economy, r and g are apples and oranges and cannot be compared. Economic growth (g) is not the return on the real economy in the same way that r is the return on capital and its assets. R is intended to compensate for a panoply of risks and is comparable to the wave function in Quantum Mechanics: it incorporates all the publicly and privately available information about future uncertainties and provides a distribution function of all plausible scenarios. Put simply: subject to political and market vicissitudes, capital can vanish overnight. Not so the real economy: it is always there, regardless of upheavals, political meddling (usually in the form of taxation), inflation (a kind of tax, really), and disruptive technologies.Capital (wealth) can be construed as a call option on the real economy and, especially, on real estate and emerging technologies. R amounts, therefore, to the premium on this option. Income inequality is growing because of the decline in the role and importance of labor, which is being gradually supplanted by capital assets, such as robots and computers as well as being offshored, outsourced, and downsized. Again, put simply; capital can buy a lot more labor nowadays, hence the apparent lopsidedness of the distribution of wealth.Luckily for the 99%, the bulk of the nation’s wealth is inactive: dormant in deposits and other long-term assets or languishing in hordes of cash in the form of non-distributed profits. Such capital exercises political clout and muscle but is irrelevant in terms of wage compression.Inherited wealth is no different to any other form of capital. It is merely an extension of the investment horizon, a kind of immortality. If Warren Buffet lives to be 300 or hands what’s left of his wealth to future generations of Buffets is immaterial in terms of economic impact. There is no evidence that inherited wealth is less productive than riches obtained via entrepreneurship. Such claims have more to do with seething envy than with scholarly erudition. Inherited wealth concentrated in the hands of the few may be compared to an oligopoly, not necessarily a bad thing.There is no basis to prefer one type of economic activity over another on strictly scientific grounds: investment is as important as entrepreneurship and finance is as crucial as manufacturing. Wealth – inherited or not – is always invested: either in the financial sector or in the real one. To rank economic activities as more or less preferable is ideology, not science: a judgment that is driven by values and predilections, not by hard data.Similarly, to talk about a monolithic, immutable oligarchy is laughable. As any casual perusal of Forbes’ list of richest people would show, the mobility inside this group is remarkable and its composition is in constant flux. Most of its new members are there by virtue of wages and bonuses."

The report catalogs conflicts of interest, heedless risk-taking and failures of federal oversight that helped push the country into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The Levin-Coburn report expands on evidence gathered at four Subcommittee hearings in April 2010, examining four aspects of the crisis through detailed case studies: high-risk mortgage lending, using the case of Washington Mutual Bank, a $300 billion thrift that became the largest bank failure in U.S. history; regulatory inaction, focusing on the Office of Thrift Supervision’s failed oversight of Washington Mutual; inflated credit ratings that misled investors, examining the actions of the nation’s two largest credit rating agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s; and the role played by investment banks, focusing primarily on Goldman Sachs, creating and selling structured finance products that foisted billions of dollars of losses on investors, while the bank itself profited from betting against the mortgage market."

You can make steady money all year round but Christmas is when you can really bank.I netted over $6,450 in December 2012 thanks to the Amazon Affiliate Program and PPC advertising.I turned to PPC arbitrage because Google killed my sites in the search engines. To be fair, I was paying outsourcers to build anchor text links.  Anyways, what's important is I found another way to make money - and this one is more steady. I actually stumbled into this a little bit by accident.  I heard my dad blabbing on and on about some new tech gadgets for Christmas and decided to try advertising those products.I didn't know this would work...I just tried something no one else was.  A lot of people could have been doing the exact same thing but I'd guess there were maybe 10-15 others at most.You could say I got lucky but that's not quite true.  I try a lot of stuff just to see what works.  A lot of time my experiments fail but I know all it takes is one quick hit on the Internet and you can make a lot of money really fast.I used Amazon's affiliate program to make almost all the money.  What makes that surprising is I actually hated using Amazon's affiliate ads before this.I used to think the Amazon Affiliate program sucked.  Every time I put Amazon on one of my sites previously, I never made more money than Google Adsense.But I kept reading how people were making thousands with Amazon and I thought I had to give it another chance; There had to be something I was missing.Fast forward and now it's the reverse.  I make way more money with Amazon than I do anything else.  It took this PPC experiment to really figure out how to leverage Amazon ads and really make money from them - despite the 24 hour cookie.You're going to get the secrets, the tricks, the kitchen sink...Everything that I did to make my ridiculous ROI, I'll show you in this book.My favorite part about PPC Advertising, PPC Arbitrage, and making money with Amazon Affiliate is it all boils down to the cold hard numbers.  Nothing else matters.  If you can make the numbers work, you can make passive income for a long, long time.  Not nearly as much as you'll make during Christmas but really steady money.It comes down to testing different niches.  If you get fancy, you can even test different website layouts.Important: I Took ActionThe most success I've had and the most money I've made in Internet Marketing is when I took action and asked questions later.  Of course I made a ton of mistakes but I figured them out as I went along.  If you sit back and wait for all the conditions to be perfect, you'll pay for hesitating.Don't assume everything based on what you read or hear.  Let your experience guide you.$6,500 in a Month, 'Nuf SaidIf I can make $6,500 clear in one month with 40 hours of work, I think that's a pretty good sign there's still plenty of money to be made if you're willing to put in a little time and effort.If you read this book, you can guess and check your way into some niches that make a passive income.  Yeah, it'll take a little startup capital and a few dozen man hours but that's really all you need.  If you're not willing to do that, then you're not serious about making money.100% Money Back GuaranteeI put this here so you aren't afraid to try this book out.The truth is this book is awesome.

Those penalties disappear at full retirement age.•If you take benefits early and lose some or all of them because of Social Security's earnings test, Social Security will actuarially increase your benefits starting at your full retirement age based on the number of months of benefits you forfeited. •A married couple could be looking at a lifetime Social Security benefit in excess of $1 million.The bullet points above are just a few basic rules and information about Social Security, and yet few people are aware of these concepts.   In fact, the majority of Americans spend more time planning their next vacation than examining their options and strategies for when to begin this vital income stream. Finding a professional to provide objective advice can also prove difficult. Banks and other financial institutions don't train advisors to provide advice on claiming strategies and Social Security Administration personnel are neither trained nor allowed to give advice.  The optimal age to take Social Security retirement benefits is dependent upon a large number of interrelated and individual factors which must be considered.  You cannot assume that commonly held misconceptions such as ""You should always file as early as you can for benefits"" or ""You need to stop working to receive benefits"" are correct or represent the optimal strategy for YOU.  These one-size-fits-all answers leave many retirees failing to maximize the benefits they have earned.   Author Lisa Hay, CPA,  CFP®, combines a clear and friendly writing style with tax and financial planning expertise to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the myriad of factors involved in the complex decision of when to begin Social Security retirement benefits.  This book will help you construct smart claiming strategies that will enhance your lifetime income and minimize your risk of running out of money!Neither investors nor advisors can control the financial markets, but with good Social Security planning you can maximize the chances of a happy retirement.

Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century?    In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves: The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from The New Yorker over the same period.    Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the ""dog whisperer"" who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and ""hindsight bias"" and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate.    ""Good writing,"" Gladwell says in his preface, ""does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else's head."" What the Dog Saw is yet another example of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary."

How to Start a Foreclosure Cleanup Business is the most up-to-date, thorough analysis of how to start and grow a foreclosure cleanup business. A foreclosure cleanup business is responsible for primarily the cleaning, clearing and maintenance of properties that have been foreclosed upon. Services offered by these enterprises involve interior and exterior repair and maintenance, ranging from debris removal, boarding of windows and doors, changing locks, inspections, painting, and more. The foreclosure cleanup industry is growing as a result of the astronomical number of foreclosures on the market today. Though often termed ""property preservation companies,"" foreclosure cleanup companies are actually different in that they are generally smaller contractors that work as arms of larger property preservation companies. The larger property preservation companies, in most scenarios, work directly with HUD (the Department of Housing and Urban Development). Increasingly, the larger companies are relying on the services of smaller foreclosure cleanup companies, who act as foot soldiers in the management, cleanup, and repair of properties in pre-foreclosure and foreclosure states. How to Start a Foreclosure Cleanup Business includes the following topics: Business start-up, licensing, insurance, pricing, marketing, HUD subcontracting resources, start-up sample forms, copies of actual bids, and much more. Readers get detailed direction on niche marketing, working with larger contractors, choosing helpers, licensing and insurance, uniforms, equipment and supply purchasing versus renting, and other necessary information to help them start and grow a successful foreclosure cleanup enterprise in 2011 and beyond. Further, readers receive a detailed look at several foreclosure cleanup bids won and jobs completed, with a step-by-step analysis of how each job unfolded. (All information is from the first-hand account of an Atlanta-based foreclosure cleanup business owner.) The author is a realtor, real estate contractor, investor, and foreclosure cleanup business owner. As a result, readers learn crucial start-up tactics from a real estate professional with pointed experience in several real estate industry capacities. How to Start a Foreclosure Cleanup Business is unique in that it provides a detailed perspective on starting and growing a foreclosure cleanup business from a seasoned professional who has successfully worked on many levels in the real estate industry."

276,B00BGTGA76,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BGTGA76,Cómo Generar Ingresos Pasivos: Sistemas Automatizados para Ganar Dinero (Spanish Edition),2.99,"¿Estás en búsqueda de la Libertad Financiera? Entonces, es el momento preciso de aprender acerca de los ingresos pasivos....Si eres un(a) empleado(a), contratista, o te pagan una tarifa por hora, este libro cambiará radicalmente la forma en la que ves el dinero y los ingresos que recibes a partir de tu actividad laboral.Los ingresos pasivos son dinero o recursos que puedes recibir de forma periódica a partir de sistemas qué funcionan de forma autónoma o semi-autónoma. Los ingresos pasivos son conocidos también como rentas, utilidades o ingresos residuales. Cuando utilizas sistemas generadores de ingresos pasivos, los flujos de dinero continúan llegando independientemente de si te encuentras realizando o no un trabajo durante un período en particular. Por el contrario, los ingresos activos (producto de salarios, pago de contratos o cuotas por hora) desaparecen muy rápido una vez que dejas de trabajar activamente: Si la empresa te despide, te quedas sin salario. Si no cumples en tiempo con tus contratos, no hay pagos. Si no atiendes a tus clientes, no recibes tus cuotas. Cuando trabajas como un empleado, el valor que generas es entregado a una sola persona (tu jefe) y por consiguiente, es la única persona que te paga. Es como tener un negocio con un solo cliente (muy arriesgado, por cierto).Cuando trabajas con sistemas de ingresos pasivos, puedes compartir el mismo valor que generas con muchas personas. Si lo que generas es útil, más personas querrán pagar por obtenerlo. Entre más hábil te vuelvas generando y entregando valor a las personas, mayores serán tus flujos de ingresos pasivos.Los ingresos pasivos no son un esquema que prometa volverte millonario de la noche a la mañana (aunque es el favorito de las personas ricas), pero sí te ofrecen un método mucho más inteligente para trabajar y hacer dinero. La construcción de sistemas generadores de ingresos es un trabajo arduo, pero sus resultados son fantásticos.Los ingresos pasivos se basan en conceptos poderosos como la creación de valor, el servicio a las personas, la generosidad y tu desarrollo personal continuo. Si deseas mejorar tus finanzas y tu relación con el dinero, este libro te ayudará a encontrar el camino.Si eres un emprendedor o estás interesado en la creación de ingresos pasivos, no puedes dejar de leer este libro. La información que encontrarás en él, será para ti como ""oro de 24 kilates"".

278,B00FFJIW9M,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FFJIW9M,Engage Your Focus: Harness Your Power to Achieve Great Things (Your Personal Development Book 4),0.00,"Even though it’s a skill that can be learned not everyone has the ability to focus, and not everyone wants to. Having focus means that you have ambition and a burning desire to change your life for the better. Changing your life for the better takes commitment, hard work, living outside of the box, and the willingness to take risks. I think that most people don’t realize that they are much more able than their mind allows them to believe. Most people accept the hand that life deals them and they don’t take action to change anything. I remember going to a job interview not long after I left College all fired up with energy and enthusiasm. When telling me about the person that I would be assisting the Managing Director told me that he had no interest in doing any overtime, he was happy to do his job and go. At that point in my rather naïve understanding of life I was stunned, I genuinely couldn’t understand that attitude! Now that I’m older and hopefully a wee bit wiser I can recognize that if someone is happy and content with what they do then they should be applauded, because far too many people don’t find that level of happiness. This book is for those who have drive and ambition. This book is for those who are driven by their goals, those who are unable to just do their bit and go. This book is for those who need the focus to achieve their full potential. “Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing”Abraham LincolnIf you want to succeed, if you want to achieve your goals and if you want to achieve your full potential then you have be totally focused on attaining it. If you are studying for your exams you can’t take the time to swan off on vacation. If you are preparing to compete in the Olympics you can’t decide not to train. If you are trying to win a new client you cannot go in unprepared. If you want to achieve success then you need a clear picture of what you want in your mind, and once you have that picture you have to take action and go get it.“Fear not that your life shall come to an end, but rather fear that it never has a beginning.”Cardinal NewmanThere are certain fundamental basics in the universe and one of those is that at some point you will die and there is no way of escaping that fact. None of us knows when our time will be up, although saying that I’ve come close more than a few times. Given that you only have one life doesn’t it make sense to make the most out of it? It’s up to you what you do with your life, but at some point in the future will you look back with regret at wasted opportunities? Time is our most precious possession, when it’s gone it’s gone, so don’t spend your life hiding away from your potential! If you have ambitions then strive to achieve them. If you have goals then stay focused on them until you achieve them. Have hope and believe in what you can achieve, and never forget that there is more to you than you allow yourself to believe.

286,B00ERIN1ES,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ERIN1ES,Become an Event Planner: The Three Necessary Steps to Begin Your Event Planning Career,2.99,"“Become an Event Planner” is different from all of the other “how to plan events” books because it is not, in fact, a book about how to plan events.  Instead, it is written for the beginner who needs to understand how to begin their career.  “Should I start my own event planning business, and how do I get started?”“Why can’t I find any information on anything other than party planning and wedding planning?”“What kind of certification or schooling do I need?”“How do I get hired without any experience?”“What am I doing wrong, and why aren’t I getting any return calls on my resumes?” If you’ve decided that you want to become an event planner, chances are you’ve asked yourself these questions.  Perhaps you’ve sent out a few resumes, but haven’t heard back.  You’re wondering how, exactly, you’re supposed to break into the industry without any experience; and yet how can you get any experience if you can’t get a job?  Or maybe you’re wondering how to even find the available jobs, because there don’t seem to be any job postings in your area. And so, in desperation, you’ve decided that you’re going to start your own event planning business.  But trust me; this is the single biggest mistake you can ever make.  And in this eBook, I explain why.  Additionally, I discuss one of the least-discussed realties in the event planning business; it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to make a living as a “party planner” planning birthday parties and anniversary parties.  I also strongly against going into wedding planning; and if that’s of interest to you, you might read what I have to say about that before investing your time and effort in pursuing that career path.  However, every single book, eBook, and online certification course out there seems to focus on party planning and wedding planning.  Why?  Because it’s an easy sell.  It is not, however, realistic; so in the interest of saving yourself a huge amount of wasted time and money, it’s imperative that you read what I have to say before you invest in any online course or certification.  Not only do I explain why you need to step out of the “party planning” mentality in order to build a lucrative, exciting career, but I explain what areas of event planning you should focus on in order to succeed; the large category of special events (including fundraisers, festivals, and community events) and corporate event planning.  These are the two areas in which you can actually make a good living and find solid, on-going, consistent work.  Which career path sounds more profitable, stimulating, and promising; a career planning large-scale special events and multi-million-dollar corporate meetings, or planning children’s birthday parties and baby showers?  And finally, I explain the essential steps you simply must take if you ever hope to begin a career in event planning; and explain why these steps are necessary for your success.   Quite simply, if you don’t follow these steps, you will never get a call back, you will never land an interview, and you’ll never break into the exciting world of event planning.  However, if you do follow these steps, you increase your chances of success by a thousandfold.  And how do I know?  Because I’ve had countless people who followed my advice email me to tell me of their success.  So are you ready?  Are you ready to do what it takes to achieve your dream?  It all starts here; with the download of one simple eBook.  I promise you, someday you’ll look back and won’t believe how your life has changed; and how the career of your dreams started with a click……"

This nightmare is something that most entrepreneurs and innovators have to deal with at some point in their career because most startups and new products fail in the market.If your new product or service fails fast and cheaply, you will have the time, resources and energy to try something else – and keep trying until you have a hit.

Pretotyping can help you avoid ""The Innovator's Nightmare"" by helping you make sure that your are building the right 'it' before you invest too much time and money to build 'it' right. In this book, Alberto Savoia, a successful Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur, angel investor and former Google Engineering Director and Innovation Agitator, introduces the basic principles and tools of pretotyping along with many examples.Alberto's work on pretotyping has made him one of the most popular and requested Google speakers.

Because before you can expect any of that to work for you, you have to have the kind of business that attracts top-quality customers and clients willing, able and even eager to pay you top whack for your products and services.Look... if you are struggling with cruddy customers and clients, price-buyers who slash your fees and prices, are almost impossible to satisfy and are then glacially slow to pay, then where does the responsibility lie?If your customers suck... do you know whose fault it is?It's... YOURS.And they suck... because YOU LET THEM.Why do I say this?Because everyone you do business with is someone you agreed to do business with. You can argue you had no idea what they were going to turn out like, but in that case it's still your fault for not having your Bullshit Filters in place.

Read this book with an open mind.What you'll discover in it has not only worked well for me, but it's worked well for my clients, too.If you follow the guidelines I share with you here you will, I promise, no longer have customers and clients who suck.About the AuthorIs there a reason so many Multimillionaire Entrepreneurs from the US have paid Jon for his Marketing genius, 4,000 miles and a half-dozen time zones away at a ruinous exchange rate rather than use good ol' homegrown talent?Of course there is.And it ain't because of his height, hair or good looks...Jon's clients include Chris Cardell, the UK’s No 1 marketing educator (who incidentally described Jon as “my marketing righthand man”), several members of both his and Dan Kennedy’s Platinum Inner Circles, as well as dozens of business owners on both sides of the Atlantic. Jon has been featured in the Irish Times, Bill Glazer’s book, Outrageous Advertising, and has ghostwritten for at least one big name you would definitely recognize.Quite simply Jon has earned his nickname of ""The Evil Bald Genius"" because of his tell-it-like-it-is way of leading struggling business owners into the land of profit-plenty.Don't take his word for it - read  the book and make up your own mind."

It is now time to give salespeople the role they factually can play: entrepreneurs within the enterprise. They must freely be able to share information in all directions, and actually contribute to product and service innovation resulting from being the prime contact points with customers. Kimla lays out the methods by which this is possible--and vital role IT must play in bringing it about.This book lays no claim to having formulated incontrovertible principles for the future of IT related Sales issues in the economy and society nor did it intend to. That would be presumptuous given the incredible dynamism of this industry and its interdependencies. Instead, the eight theses are presented here in an attempt to put up for discussion certain orientation points for future development. Just as process-based thinking and planning is needed for IT related Sales issues implementation so too is a process-based approach required to clarify the significance and potential of IT.
