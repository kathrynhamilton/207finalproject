This useful little book is a pocket guide on how to operate any enterprise, described from the point of view of the services it delivers.  After all, delivery is what success is all about.  It describes the basics, in realistic pragmatic terms. And it is brief – we limited ourselves to 50 pages.Whether you are in manufacturing, trades, retail, IT, public sector, not-for-profit…; whether you provide service internally to the rest of your organisation or externally to paying customers; whether you work anywhere from a small business to a government department; this book introduces you to service management.It will get you started, get you up and running, and it will set you on the path to the advanced concepts if that is where you need to be.  Or this book and its website may be all you need.If you are interested in this book, you probably don’t manage your services so much.  That gives you an opportunity to increase revenues and profitability:  improving your service brings increased efficiency and effectiveness.  That means increased returns for much less investment than from improving your products or equipment.Service management gets your whole organisation working “outside-in”: talking to customers, understanding customers, thinking about yourselves in customer terms, seeing yourselves as customers see you, giving customers service that they want.In this century, if you run a business it is most likely a service business whether you know it or not.  Customers don’t want to simply buy something any more.  They don’t simply want something done.  They want to have a nice easy experience with added value – to be served.Whether you build roads or map them, operate ports or use them, build houses or sell them, plan weddings or sing at them, care for kids or clothe them, sell PCs or scrap them, you are in a service business, even if you may not be in a “service industry”.We aren’t talking about over-the-counter “may I help you?” service, the focus of a number of books.   Those books tell you how to develop the customer service interface, the experience of contact.  This book is about the end-to-end process of providing services, and most of all about how to manage them.  This book generalises the concepts that have been recently refined in the Information Technology industry – the current “experts” in this topic (even if it doesn’t feel that way sometimes).Here is Basic Service Management, describing the basics you need to start in managing real business services, to get by.  It will set you on the road to gold-standard service or it just may be all you need.   We have taken the central ideas from a range of sources and summarised them in plain English and pragmatic terms.  Use what is good for you; get started with what we give you; then follow the references for more when you need it."

21,B007M9CLOA,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007M9CLOA,Practical Contract Management,14.99,"This book is about Contract Management. As a subject, this has tended to be viewed as being very much the junior partner in the procurement cycle or the part of the process that is somebody else’s problem. There are many first class texts on how to manage the procurement cycle right up to the award of contract and this textbook in no way attempts to compete with them. We are attempting to fill a perceived gap in the general literature by giving some practical advice to those who are responsible for managing contracts, but struggle to find a single textbook covering the subject.All too often, once the contract has been placed, there has been an expectation that somehow the contract will manage itself. Supposedly all the hard work in issuing invitations to tender and evaluating bids and carrying out negotiations has been completed and the most economically advantageous or best value for money bid has been selected. This is entirely right and proper, but fails to recognise that professional contract management can also bring about significant cost savings, quality, delivery improvements and innovations to products, services or business processes.This book covers both the hard and soft issues regarding contract management. As well as looking at for example how to hold an inaugural meeting or deal with a contractual claim, we also discuss the nature of the relationship with the contractor, looking at both adversarial and collaborative models as well as measures you might take to motivate the contractor.The book is written from the standpoint of getting it right first time; we view good contract management as a positive adding value process. Nevertheless the book does not shy away from the fact that things do and will go wrong and therefore there are also chapters on dispute resolution and legal issues that might affect the individual managing the contract.It is clear from reports from government bodies and private sector research, that there is scope for substantial savings through good contract management. It is a professional discipline that should be carried out by professionals, which should lead to better contractor performance."

40,B005M784HW,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005M784HW,Red on Blue: Establishing Republican Governance,9.99,"This work is a high-level state government bureaucrat and Republican appointee's view of the organization and processes of governments with a particular view of the change processes when Republicans take over a government established and run by Democrats. The central thesis is that governments are built by Democrats to be run by Democrats and it is essentially impossible for a Repubican executive to staff and run a government established by Democrats.The work details the necessary management of people, money, and ""stuff"" in a government and how a new Republican executive can safely reorganize and remove holdover Democrats and their allies in the bureaucracy. The course laid out has been successful but will cause the new administration to be on the receiving end of every form of protest and invective the unions, the Democrat front groups and clients, and the Democrats themselves can hurl at the Administration. You are warned; if you just must be a nice guy, this isn't for you.The work has a heavy emphasis on dealing with public employee unions and the employer's rights and duties in a unionized public employment enviroment. While the writer is not a lawyer and cannot offer legal advice, and laws vary from jurisdiction to juridiction, there is extensive exploration of successful strategy and tactics in dealing with unions politically, in the grievance process, and in contract negotiation. While recent events have brought governmental relations with unionized public employees to the forefront of public attention, public employee relations is an arcana known to few and misunderstood and misrepresented by many. The writer is one of only a handful of Republican political appointees who has actually successfully dealt with a fully unionized public workforce under Republican governments. Dealing with unions in a union state doesn't look the same as it does from a Southern right-to-work state with no unionized employees and where people believe that the state education association really is only for the children.A new Republican governor, mayor, or other executive will be excoriated by the media, dismissed as stupid by the elites and academics, sabotaged, leaked, and thwarted by by the bureaucracy and holdover democrats, and face re-election with his/her polls in the toilet. This book is intended as an ""owner's manual"" for government to keep a Republican executive from becoming a one-term footnote or a laughing stock on Saturday Night LIve. Read and learn."

The tools and steps in this book will help inventors to successfully develop and market their inventions without breaking the bank. I am an engineer with over 25 years experience developing and marketing products.  I have used my corporate and entrepreneurial experience to develop this step by step guide to help fellow inventors develop their products using a ""boot strapping"" approach.  In the book I detail some of the products I have invented and tell you what I learned along the way so you don't make the same mistakes I did.  Some of the products I have invented are: an automatic fire extinguisher, a low cost snow plow for trucks and SUV’s that costs < $1000, a trailer hitch alignment device that allows you to hook up a trailer without getting out of the vehicle, and a pint glass that keeps your beer cold without diluting with ice.  One of the biggest questions you need to answer is whether your invention is unique.  I show you how to do that with patent and product searches.  I then explain how to document your product development progress and how to prototype your invention to make sure it works and to improve the functionality.   I then discuss options from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to protect your invention intellectual property and how to find companies to license your invention.  This book also includes several inventor resources as well as details on companies looking for new products.  Just having an idea is the easy part.  Taking it from an idea to a licensed product has many steps to make sure that you have a marketable product.  The process detailed in this book also helps you determine whether you should abandon your idea before spending too much money.  You want to spend the least amount of money to develop, protect and market your inventions.  That way you can make sure your royalties go to your bank account instead of going to pay off loans for expensive prototypes or legal fees.   Inventor's Workshop is a ""take action"" guide to turning your ideas into successful products that can make passive income from royalty fees you receive from manufacturers that license your product."

77,B005JFBO6U,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JFBO6U,Faith and Finance: Peace With or Without Prosperity,2.99,"SYNOPSIS:Faith and Finance takes the fear out of financial management and making ends meet by guiding the reader through God’s scriptural promises on provision.  It is a straightforward approach to looking at your stewardship through God’s eyes, hitting key points like debt, retirement, giving, lending, multiple incomes, peace in the home, and much more. BACK:A preacher once said, “Everyone is looking for peace. Everyone wants to take a deep breath and release a sigh of relief that is not just on the outside, but on the inside. That’s what we can have as Christians, but we have to appropriate what God has given to us to have that.”  This book will take you through a journey that will plow the ground of your heart, lay a new foundation of financial principles based on the word of God, and help enable you to weather the inevitable financial storms of life – with peace.  It doesn’t matter if your checking account is overflowing or empty, peace comes from knowing your footing is sure with every choice you make in your stewardship.  No longer do you have to feel like the double-minded man tossed to and fro, uncertain about every decision. You can raise your shield of faith against each fiery dart by resting on the scriptural principles found within Faith and Finance – Peace With or Without Prosperity.EXCERPTS:Money reveals the love of our heart.  Money reveals the pride in our heart.  Money reveals whether we want to do it God’s way, or our way.  This is not anything new.-How many people have heard the story about the drunk who got his paycheck and drank it away leaving a starving family at home?What about the man who bought a sports car, went golfing every weekend, went out to eat with his friends weekly and when he died he left his family with piles of debt and no life insurance?-God knows the potential and ability of each man and will lead him to reach it.  If a man is lazy in the stewardship of his life, he will be held accountable for his waste.  If a man is hasty in his choices and makes “investments” that go against the principles of God’s word, he will also be accountable for his stewardship.  But a man that prayerfully and diligently works at increasing his ability within the bounds of God’s word has a greater opportunity to be used of God in finance.That being said, financial increase is not what we work toward.  We work toward good stewardship, and as God provides we are able to do more to increase His work in our lives.-When listing off His commandments, covetousness is the only one God becomes specific about.-We women sacrifice peace when we leave our children behind for hours and find ourselves feeling guilty and insecure about our choices in this area.  We sacrifice our God given peace oft times just for financial security.  We enjoy knowing that our bills are being paid faster; our securities are growing as we would like; and we may be able to enjoy a vacation now and then.What we don’t realize is that we are hampering our own spiritual growth and our husband’s growth in the Lord.-Christians get so ensnared in what I call the “bittersweet abundance” that comes with government assistance that I see people falsifying their income or hiding cash they receive just to stay on assistance.  If they saw God as their provider they would need not lie, because you cannot lie to God.  They see the government as their provider and lie to stay in good graces.  That is the snare.  It is when one stops recognizing God as their provider, and they shift their eyes elsewhere that Satan wins the victory.That is what Satan desires.  He wants a Godless people.-I entitled this book “Faith and Finance - Peace With or Without Prosperity” because God’s Word promises peace to those who keep their mind upon Him; not those who keep their checking account full. -We will find ourselves looking back and wondering, “My goodness, how did that all work out? God surely is faithful, isn’t He?"

Regain Control of Your Company's ROI.,9.95,"At the end of the day, you, the CEO must determine what is and isn’t working for your company.Yet, trapped by old-school marketing practices that don’t fit your company, and perpetuate finger-pointing between sales and marketing, it’s hard to break through and grow to the next level. That’s unless you were able to make your marketing a science, and quickly discern What Really Counts.  It’s a brave new world for CEOs; from old-school print advertising to Web 2.0 social networks and the emergence of digital strategies, CEOs of every sized company still have no idea which part of their marketing works, which part doesn’t and what they should invest in to enhance their company’s long-term success. This confusion leads to CEOs spending more marketing budget dollars than necessary, squandering profit margins and resources that could be used elsewhere.  If the CEO does not understand which parts of the marketing effort are producing the best ROI, there is a strong likelihood that he/she will cut the very infrastructure required to restore the company’s vitality.  What Really Counts for CEOs, uncovers the key challenges CEOs face, and gives you the tools needed to treat marketing as a science. You will be asked to think differently, to ask the right questions to your marketing, sales and communication teams that will produce better answers that lead to meaningful metrics resulting in marketing outcomes that can be repeated and adjusted accordingly. In short, you will find out What Really Counts and make it work hard for your money."

84,B00B10MBJQ,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B10MBJQ,The Viral Startup: A Guide to Designing Viral Loops,5.99,"If you’re interested in what it takes to grow a business from 10 users to 10 million, you should check out this collection of Andrew Chen’s most compelling writings on viral marketing. You’ll learn how to conduct awesome A/B tests and how to find out exactly what your customers truly want from your product.ExcerptProduct design fact: A small number of features are used a lot, and most features are never used.This idea comes from one of my favorite books, Designing Interactions, where there’s a discussion by the original interaction designer for one of the first/best mobile OSes, PalmOS. He talks about the idea that users’ interaction with products follow a Power Law distribution- a small number of features are used constantly by users, and then there’s a long tail of features that most people don’t interact with at all. This is an important idea, because it helps define what good functional design should look like.Good designGood interaction design means giving features prominence based on their usage level- this means some features are basically hidden, whereas some should be in your face. Using Palm as the example, you’d want to make “Add contact to addressbook” prominent but “Remove contact” should be very subtle- possible, but almost hidden. This means users will be able to pick out what they want to do, most of the time, and occasionally can pick out the corner case.Open designOn the other hand, designing your product to be “open” and a “platform” means that you want to make anything possible. This often comes with its own design risks, because features aren’t shown to the user at the priority level associated with their usage. That’s why I find that open systems like Android, Windows, and the Facebook platform can have very messy interactions as a result.An open platform means that a lot more is possible, but the best experiences are watered down by its desire to support an infinite number of possibilities. A more curated experience means that the best experiences can be meticulously designed, but it becomes harder to make all the combinations possible. Constraints start to dominate, but if the constraints are picked well, the experience is better off.Different POVsYou can read this post as a discussion of Apple versus Google versus Microsoft, or you can think of it as different design philosophies for how to build products. Both are great, and can lead to fantastic things, but open versus curated can lead to very different outcomes."

111,B00BTMAQIE,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BTMAQIE,Realizing the Possibility of an Exceptional American Future,3.99,"In the wisdom of its Founding Fathers, the strength of its Constitution, and numerous other ways, America has experienced an exceptional past.  But it is not the past that is the decisive, the determining force in a nation; nations “are made and go on living by having a program for the future” (Ortega y Gasset 1974: 26).  This book proposes a program to realize the possibility of an exceptional American future of rising economic welfare, justice, and opportunity.  Central to understanding this program is the concept of culture, a “repertory of solutions” to problems of living.  The work of Adam Smith describes a culture of liberty in which individuals identify those phenomena they regard as problems of living, and are free to pursue their own solutions to these problems.  Part I presents the distinguishing characteristics of Smith’s culture, and explains to a general audience of readers why his culture gives rise to the possibility of an exceptional American future.Realizing the possibility of an exceptional American future requires politicians to supply Smith’s culture.  Because the demanders of public policies in America are voters, politicians will supply Smith’s culture if the demand for his culture among voters is sufficiently strong to spur them to do so.  The simple fact that politicians have yet to supply Smith’s culture provides sufficient evidence that this condition remains unsatisfied.  Consequently, whether America will realize the possibility of its exceptional future of rising economic welfare, justice, and opportunity has yet to be determined.  Part II identifies two features of circumstance that limit the growth in demand for Smith’s culture among voters, and proposes long-run strategies to reckon with each of these features.  It also identifies a third feature of circumstance that imperils realizing the possibility of an exceptional American future, and proposes a long-run strategy to reckon with this feature of circumstance as well.It is also possible for American voters to make a culture of government dominant in this nation.  In cultures of government the state decides those phenomena that citizens are to regard as problems of living, and imposes government solutions to these problems.  Part III identifies a variety of costs that cultures of government impose on America, and argues that the choice to make a culture of government dominant in this nation is the simultaneous choice of an American future of decline, decay, and ultimately national death. Part IV presents an array of five cultures that confront American voters as options for choice.  Further, because politics lies downstream from culture in democratic nations, Part IV also presents the political parties in America that foster these cultural options.  Although realizing the possibility of an exceptional American future depends in the long run on the choice by voters to make Smith’s culture dominant in this nation, the book also proposes a short-run political tactic that voters can employ as a means to the same objective."

124,B00BQ4778W,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BQ4778W,Map the Future,9.99,"“Even before finishing the book, I had written a stream of emails to my professional colleagues, making suggestions for new approaches in our projects, based on the examples I had just read.”—David W. Wood, Technology Planning Lead, Accenture MobilityMap the Future is a how-to book for business strategy. It teaches you how to combine information about competitors, customers, and technology trends to spot future opportunities and problems before they're obvious, which lets you grab opportunities before anyone else, and get ready for your competitors' responses before they happen. Written by a tech industry executive who managed product and business strategy at companies including Apple and Palm, the book is full of hands-on practical guidance for anyone who works on strategy, from individual contributor to senior manager. “Map the Future is your cookbook for developing a strong roadmap and strategy. I wish I'd had a guide like Map the Future when I started my career. ”—Gina Clark, Vice President & General Manager, Integrated Collaboration Group, Cisco Systems, Inc. Most companies think about the future the wrong way. Visionary companies try to impose their will on the future, like a military drill sergeant; analytical companies try to predict the future in detail, like a weather report. Both approaches fail when there are changes we didn't anticipate. The reality is that the future's not determined yet, so you can't predict it exactly, and you can't always control it. What we need instead is a map of the possibilities, like a highway map for the future, so you can see where you can and can't go, and then nudge events toward the future you want to see. Map the Future teaches you how to build that future roadmap, and how to use it to drive strategy.“Map the Future explains the small steps and the big ones in a clear, compelling and convincing narrative that’s fun to read, too. I wish all the business guidebooks I've read were as good as this one.”—Matt Bacon, Deputy Director, Device Strategy and Communication, Orange-France Telecom GroupThe book is organized like a cookbook. It starts with an overview that's relevant to all readers, and then dives into detailed how-to instructions on strategy-related subjects, ranging from how to manage a competitive analysis team to how to influence people who don't want to listen. There's a lot of information on what works and doesn't work in large companies, but there are also sections on what to do if you're in a small company or startup.Topics covered include:-How to create a future road map and use it to drive strategy-How to segment the market for a new product-How to recruit and manage competitive analysis and market research teams-How to create and use technology forecasts-How to lead Agile product development through strategy-How to do competitive analysis and market research if you’re in a small company with no budget-How to read the adoption curve and how to tell when you’ve crossed the chasm-How to influence a large company-How to apply competitive, market, and advanced technology research to strategy“Map the Future is an indispensable complement to all the executive strategy guides and market research manuals overflowing airport bookstores everywhere.”—Craig Froehle, Ph.D., Professor, Lindner College of Business, University of CincinnatiABOUT THE AUTHOR.  A longtime veteran of Silicon Valley, Michael Mace has co-founded two startups, and worked as an executive and consultant for many of the industry’s leading firms.

This e-book is the first in a series of books that are intended to walk the reader through the application of the six sigma tools in a way they can understand the real intent of the tool. So many classes teach the tools, and fill the student’s tool box with a jumbled mess of tools they will never use covering the useful tools they really need to understand.  The purpose of this text is not to provide technical expertise in the subject of the process discussed, Pizza making in this example, but to demonstrate how to select and apply process improvement tools to better understand and improve process performance. This book will discuss the six sigma methodology as it applies to a Pizza shop owner who suspects her sales are declining due to customers that are becoming dissatisfied with her pizza process."

They need (and deserve) the same good advice as their wealthier neighbors. Armed with the right knowledge about 401(k)s and IRAs, every retiree can have a winning strategy. Top advisors Dean Barber, Michael E. Brown and John Daley will show you the way. After reading their book, you won't have to wonder. You'll know that you've consciously made the best, most thoughtful-and right-planning decisions possible for your own retirement and for your family's future."

It will teach you how to invest wisely.Reviews:""The economy seems to be spinning out of control, and no one really knows how to bring it under control. 'Reins of Hysteria' is a guide for investors to flourish when the world burns. Peirce Stern writes with a dark humor on the matter as he advises readers to piece together their own skills and ideas to make the most of their finances for the future in a world that seems driven to see you fail. 'Reins of Hysteria' is a strong pick for personal finance and investment collections, highly recommended."" - The Midwest Book Review""Stern has a background in comedic writing as well as in business, and he combines both to keep the subject—the global financial system—enjoyable, and to uncover its inner workings. Thus, the distinctive feature of Reins of Hysteria is that it is extremely readable, despite the often complex subject matter. When an overload of information threatens to cloud his message, Sternpulls back on the throttle and uses humor to keep the reader engaged. For example, he warns of the dangers of complex options, mentioning stochastic calculus and the options pricing algorithm, then follows with a lighthearted segue to the next chapter: 'And anyhow, if you wanted to risk losing all of your money, swaps are really the best way to go.'"" - Foreword Clarion Review (Four Stars out of Five)"

For those who Write, Sell and Market eBooks.",0.99,"Secret Society for Successful eBook WritersHow did the Secret Society for Successful eBook writers form?  Here, you will get the long story since I am not in a hurry.  In July 2011, my son and I were planning a long hike on the Colorado Trail.  While waiting, I bought Bert Nemcik's eBook, ""See You Down the Trail."". It was about his 2002 hike on the Appalachian trail.  He writes looooooong and he writes well. The book is over 834 pages long. I wish it were longer. ""Shadow"" as I know him is old school.  He tells a great story and he tells all of it.His email was in the back of the book, so I contacted him and told him what a great book it was.  I forget how it got started, but we have been emailing each other almost every day.Our first big project was working on planning a 7,042 mile road hike through all the 48 states.  One of the reasons I am writing eBooks is to become financially independent so I can take this hike.  I'm one of those weird people who likes roads as much as forests.This project gave birth to the Secret Society for Successful eBook Writers, although we didn't call it that.  We both had a burning passion to take the hike. We worked together with a definiteness of purpose to plan the hike. Somewhere around December 2011, Shadow started writing, ""Ringing the Liberty Bell.""  This book is about the 2012 Presidential campaign.  Leo Pollack is an unemployed steel worker in Pennsylvania.  He was mad about how the American Dream has disappeared. So he ran for president. Every day, we worked together on the book. I would help by giving him ideas and he wrote with a style that made me race through the pages wondering what would happen. Oh, I was his chief of staff in the book. My name is Gram in the book.  I even had to bail Leo out of jail one day. Finally, I told him he had to stop, as the book was a little long at 1,034 pages.  This book gave birth to our Napoleon Hill style ""Master Mind.""  A ""Master Mind"" is two people working together with a ""Definiteness of Purpose"" in ""Perfect Harmony.""  Maybe you could buy his eBook on Amazon.  It’s a fantastic read!Well, as I was doing some motivational reading, I read Napoleon Hill's ""Law of Success.""  It was exactly what Shadow and I have been doing for almost two years.  I decided to put the book in a file and write my own notes.  Next thing I knew I had an eBook.  Every eBook writer will achieve more success with a ""Master Mind.""  They are hard to find as it takes finding two to six people with the same ""Blazing desire.""Some people want to learn how to make more money writing eBooks.  Yep, so do I and I am doing it. (Is that too many I's in one sentence?  Oh well, it's what I was thinking.)In this book, you will get a dose of Napoleon Hill and a dose of Gary Thaller. I add how you can learn to form a Napoleon Hill style of ""Master Mind"" and achieve success you never dreamed of.  Your eBooks for Amazon will improve because you have help.  There is no explaining the effect of two minds coming together with a definiteness of purpose and working in perfect harmony.  It doesn't become two.  It becomes many more than two.What the heck, this is what I really feel.  I think I'll put it in the description on Amazon and see what happens.See you down the trail,GaryAbout the AuthorI grew up in Belleville, New Jersey back in good days.  I went to Essex Catholic High School and graduated in 1971.  Off I went to the Air Force Academy.  I wasn't real big on being in the military, but ""I wanted to fly.""  A simple dream expressed in four words that got me through the Academy. I graduated in 1975 and flew the KC-135 and the T-37.  I retired after a career in the Air Force and worked in an industry I'm not supposed to talk about.  I have been self-employed at home for about 9 years."

184,B0088QTLP8,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0088QTLP8,The Forbes Model For Journalism in the Digital Age,4.63,"ABOUT THE BOOKSince its founding in 1917, Forbes has been providing insights, information, and inspiration to ensure the success of those who are dedicated to the spirit of free enterprise.Its flagship publications, Forbes and Forbes Asia, reach a worldwide audience of more than six million readers and its website, Forbes.com—the leading business site on the Web—attracts an audience that averages 30 million people per month. Forbes also publishes ForbesLife magazine and licensed editions in more than 25 countries around the world.Lewis DVorkin has always appreciated the importance of clarity, particularly in his professional life and in the media he consumes. When he first came to Forbes in the mid-1990s, he completely understood the brand and its voice. Then he left for AOL as the millennium turned. It was obvious the news cycle was getting faster and digital media was the place to be. After that, he founded a startup, True/Slant. He had a clear idea – well, he hoped he did – for a new way to produce news. Two years ago, he sold that company to Forbes, one of his investors. In re-joining a trusted brand and people he trusts as the chief product officer, he saw a direct path for the True/Slant team to take its ideas to a bigger stage. It’s worked out great. Why? Lots of reasons, especially this one: the clarity and strength of the Forbes mission.Journalism at Forbes is rooted in the conviction that success results from free enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit, smart investing – and living a life beyond the mere accumulation of dollars. Forbes is about aspiration. That message has given tremendous focus to the task of dramatically re-imagining our products and culture in the era of digital publishing and social media.ABOUT THE AUTHORLewis DVorkin serves as Chief Product Officer at Forbes Media. His long journey has taken him from The New York Times, Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal, to tabloid TV, AOL—and an instrumental role in launching TMZ.com. DVorkin has lived through a newspaper strike (sounds quaint, right?), the New York City Black Out in '77, and a bout with the Cabbage Patch Dolls. He was the founder and CEO of True/Slant, which Forbes invested in and later acquired. DVorkin first got hooked on the News business as the student editor of the Daily Iowan during the days of Vietnam, Watergate and Roe v. Wade. DVorkin would like to express his gratitude to James Bellows—a truly gifted editor, an extraordinary human being and a mentor.TABLE OF CONTENTS- Introduction: Disrupting the Media Model for News and Information- The Forbes Approach to Brand Building- Digital Journalism and the New Face of Media- News & Social Media - Online Content in the Facebook Age- A New Breed of Journalist - What Makes Forbes Writers Different- Closing Thoughts: Reimagining a Magazine as a Digital Media Marches OnEXCERPT FROM THE BOOKEntrepreneurial Journalism means digital screens that come alive with individual voice, real-time activity and dynamic content, not the homogenized, lifeless and static news pages I see on so many other news sites. When I spoke with Forbes staff reporter Deborah Jacobs about this change, she replied, “You know what’s changed for me at Forbes? I now write for my audience, not my editor.”That’s what our new model is about – listening and engaging with news consumers. Then we trust our full-time reporters and knowledgeable contributors to respond by producing content that meets their needs. And lots of it! Digital audiences can’t seem to get enough information, so it’s our job to supply it. Our unique model enabled us to provide them with quality, quantity and variety across eight key verticals, or subject areas. Our individually branded content creators, not burdened by outdated bureaucratic journalistic layers, use the publishing tools we built for them to turn out thousands of posts – nearly 100,000 in 2011."

I went through this process not too long ago, and by following some methods that I heard from other job-seekers, I was able to secure an offer from a top-tier hedge fund.There are a few books out there written about hedge fund recruiting, but most of those authors are career counselors, not actual hedge fund investors. I am, and have been for the last four years. I know what it takes to get a hedge fund job in today's market, and I've shared these tips in the guide. I offer advice on things like:1. How to use headhunters in an effective mannerMost of them are pretty useless, and even though they say they'll forward your resume along, won't actually do that. Instead, you should use headhunters to find out the names of the funds that are recruiting, and then get in touch with them directly. You will be able to get in touch with them because your network will grow considerably with some tips that I provide. 2. How to carve out your own role out at a hedge fundHedge funds are looking for employees who will make the fund more money than they will cost the fund. It's that simple. If you can show that you have ideas that are going to work, you will be hired. I'll show you how to do that. 3. What you should really do to prepare for a hedge fund interviewYes, we all know that you shouldn't wear strong cologne and have confidence. I think a 14 year old kid applying for a summer job at McDonalds knows that. For top tier hedge fund recruiting, you need to adjust your pitch in certain ways to impress the PM. The goal is to stand out. I'll tell how what specifically will impress them, and what most current interviewees aren't doing. Please find above the latest version of the report I have written. I truly hope this helps you in your job search.Good luck with the process. Please email me at hedgefundjobreport@gmail.com if you need any help, either with the document or if you're looking for advice."

If I'd known earlier what I know now I would have achieved this by 25!This little book is intended to provide spectacular, innovative and outside-the-square solutions for almost any issues you have!Generate freedom and security by dumping your problems!It has taken me 50 adult years to learn how to live properly and basically everything I have learnt in the way of attitudes and beliefs (usually the hard way) has been explained in this small book. No matter what you do you will still make mistakes but hopefully after reading this they will be small ones. The giant mistakes are the ones that mess up our lives totally and I will teach you how to correct these and hope to prevent you making more. It has been said that an old head cannot suddenly impart knowledge and wisdom to a new head but I am certainly making a major effort to help you with this material!What you will read is compressed wisdom based on absolute reality and a lifetime of experience. It gives you hands-on, practical and outside-the-square solutions to your problems which are totally workable in almost any situation. Some of the solutions to your current problems will absolutely amaze you as in hindsight they will become obvious. This book also presents you with a lifestyle philosophy that will totally change your life for the better, sometimes in a quite spectacular manner!CHAPTER HEADINGS INCLUDE - Personal Freedom, Financial Freedom, Emotional Freedom, Spiritual Freedom, Poverty Freedom, Asset Freedom, Business Freedom, Job Freedom, Fear Freedom, Choice Freedom........ PLUS MUCH MORE!I have written this book to help as many individuals as I possibly can so have kept the price low to make it easily affordable. If this knowledge does not solve your current issues then I don't know what else will!!Life is an interesting journey but at times is a little hard to relate to. It is the only journey we will make in this physical life and we have to make the best of it, even if it turns out to be a total disaster! I am hoping that by presenting this small book I will help others avoid the stupidity side of life and end up with a reasonably joyful existence. Life is there to be fulfilled! It is not intended to be an experience of total drudgery or an 80 year coffee break!A couple of hundred years ago individuals had no choice. They worked from 6 am in the morning until 6 pm at night doing the most mundane of activities and earned only enough to feed their family and keep a roof over their heads. There was little possibility of changing jobs as there was massive unemployment. Their choices were nonexistent. They were stuck in this miserable situation all their lives in atrocious working conditions.These days we have the freedom of choice. We can actually leave a job and exist on government handouts for a limited period and this is usually sufficient to supply food and shelter. There is the opportunity to become massively wealthy no matter what your educational level. Many of our richest millionaires clearly went to school mainly to eat their lunch but still they achieved outstanding success. So intelligence and education have little to do with success. Don't lose any sleep if you are one of these educational under-achievers .......the opportunities are still available!The difference between these ultra-successful individuals and the man-in-the-street is in their attitude, belief system and their ability to analyse problems and opportunities properly. They make their life-changing decisions based on universal reality.... not on their own personal fairies-in-the-bottom-of-the-garden type of reality.This is the situation I want you to be in after applying the principles in this book!This book is also part of a boxed set of 4 books titled - TRIGGER YOUR EXTRORDINARY SUBCONSCIOUS MIND: amazon.com/TRIGGER-YOUR-EXTROADINARY-SUBCONSCIOUS-ebook/dp/B00BHRQSO2/"

Talk to most people in corporations today and you will hear a common recurring theme, ""I am swamped with e-mail!"" E-mail overload is considered an inescapable fact in this information, wireless and digital age. Schedules are disrupted. Priorities are changed. The volume of e-mail grows and the stress increases exponentially. In fact workers have come to believe that this is a normal part of work.

Following the steps in this book can recover those hours and allow you to focus on what we call value work: projects and tasks that matter most to you and your organization's success. Additionally you will gain the peace of mind that all tasks are under control, you will reduce your stress because you will be less harried, and you will accomplish increased amounts of valued work that results in both a happy boss and happy clients."

This is why the majority of the top 2% of sales producers do not use any form of persuasion while interacting with prospects and customers. Some top producers learn how to sell by figuring it out on their own, through intuition, creativity, and experimentation. Others learn by watching what other top salespeople do. Very few learn by listening to someone explain how they sell. Jacques Werth first learned how to sell by studying all of the sales methods being taught by the experts. When that didn’t work, he began carefully observing what the best producers actually did. He also began experimenting with what he was learning. He discovered that the top salespeople use a sales process that is entirely different from all the rest, and is based upon very different principles. High Probability Selling tells the story of someone who encounters these ideas for the first time, and learns how to sell without persuasion. The story reveals by direct example what High Probability Selling is, but it is not a training manual on how to do it.

The kind of jobs that can be outsourced vary greatly, to the extent that nowadays you will find that almost any task that has something to do with your business can be delegated to a third party. If you are looking to enhance the support you provide to your customers, for instance, there are numerous companies both local and overseas that can provide this type of service for you.

These examples are but some of the tasks that you can outsource successfully.If you are a freelancer offering specialized services or you have a small business, chances are you have heard about outsourcing but have disregarded it. This attitude – common amongst starting and small-time entrepreneurs - stems from two misguided beliefs. The first is that only big companies have a need for it; the second, that outsourcing is an added expense that is not really necessary to the growth of a business. The truth is, anyone who wants more time in their hands can benefit immensely from outsourcing. As such, whether you own numerous establishments or you have just launched an e-commerce site for your products, you should definitely consider outsourcing to credible and qualified professionals at least one of the time-consuming tasks that do not really require your full attention or personal touch. Doing so will afford you more time – time that you can spend improving your business or engaging in other productive activities.This eBook will help you understand outsourcing and how it can help your business thrive.

How to Create, Lay Out, Write, Sell and PROFIT From Local Special-Interest Magazines",0.00,"""Write"" a magazine? That's a new concept! Yes, it is, but for 21 years, that's exactly what I did. Just me, a sales guy, and a printer.Back in 1990, I was a wedding photographer. I noticed that the brides-to-be who interviewed me had more worries than hopes for their weddings and receptions. They worried about the caterer, the floral designer, the videographer, the photographer, the officiant -- and they didn't know how to be sure they could select the right people for their big day.In short, they didn't know what to look for or how to ask people the right questions. So, after years of shooting weddings and watching the good, bad and ugly services being performed, I knew what they should ask about, how they should interview, and how they could tell whether a service provider was caring or indifferent.I wrote a little 100-page book about it, but I didn't publish it as a book. He separated its chapters into sections, by wedding specialty, got a local florist to sell ads, and published it as a magazine! That was in 1990. In 2011, it was still going strong.This concept -- a single expert in any subject writing about it and publishing it as a magazine -- remains a new approach to publishing, and one that succeeds in the smallest of markets. Take a look at any large magazine stand, and you'll see hundreds of publications on various subjects. What do they all share? Just one thing: They are NOT local! But, what do the customers browsing them all share? Just one thing: They are ALL local, and they need local services!From the book: ""It struck me that the people who walk into stores and check out the magazines are looking for information. They're looking for guidance on how to do things. For some of the things they want done, they need to hire people. And, they need to know HOW to hire the right people. They aren't going to hire people from huge institutional advertising -- they need somebody local. So, after skimming the national mags, they'll go to the local hardware store and look around. If they see a FREE publication there -- one that answers their questions -- and presents them with ads for local services and products that fill their needs, they'll pick it up, and they'll read it. They'll use the services the ads represent. It works in almost any field or subject, from weddings to medical services, from home care to pets!""In this Kindle ebook, the entire process of creating, selling and publishing is described. And, since Kindle books are not the perfect platform for color illustrations, buyers of this book will also receive FREE the entire illustrated 160-page PDF of the printed book by simply requesting it from the author (see above).I've personally written and done the layout for all of the magazines. With no other staff other than his sales representative and a printing company, I've supported my family for 21 years. One of the best things about this type of publishing is that it isn't a full-time job. For the subject of weddings, for example, the ""work year"" starts in August and ends in December; the rest of the time, I'm free to pursue other projects, while my sales rep takes care of distribution of the magazine throughout the entire publication year.This kind of project can be put together by one writer, or one graphic artist, or one sales person: The artist can hire the writer and sales rep. The sales rep can hire the writer and graphic artist.In an economy like ours, this is the perfect project!"

272,B00IFF9M0G,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IFF9M0G,Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism (The Storrs Lectures Series),7.62,"Based on a series of pathbreaking lectures given at Yale University in 2012, this powerful, thought-provoking work by national best-selling author Cass R. Sunstein combines legal theory with behavioral economics to make a fresh argument about the legitimate scope of government, bearing on obesity, smoking, distracted driving, health care, food safety, and other highly volatile, high-profile public issues. Behavioral economists have established that people often make decisions that run counter to their best interests—producing what Sunstein describes as “behavioral market failures.” Sometimes we disregard the long term; sometimes we are unrealistically optimistic; sometimes we do not see what is in front of us. With this evidence in mind, Sunstein argues for a new form of paternalism, one that protects people against serious errors but also recognizes the risk of government overreaching and usually preserves freedom of choice. Against those who reject paternalism of any kind, Sunstein shows that “choice architecture”—government-imposed structures that affect our choices—is inevitable, and hence that a form of paternalism cannot be avoided. He urges that there are profoundly moral reasons to ensure that choice architecture is helpful rather than harmful—and that it makes people’s lives better and longer."

That conversation has been reignited in 2012 and people are more heated than ever. Many service professionals have no idea how to assign value to their knowledge and most don’t know exactly how or where to draw the line between free friendly advice and fee based consultations. They find themselves being taken advantage of by people looking to get maximum information for no cost. Some people will say you have to give away a lot of free to earn paying clients. But I say that’s the quickest way to train people to expect to always get free stuff from you.It’s time to teach people where the boundaries are and how to value our expertise.In No, You Can’t Pick My Brain, It Costs Too Much, author Adrienne Graham gives practical advice on determining your value and enforcing your rules to stop the brain picking. In this book she shows you how to:* position yourself as (a respected) expert* differentiate between legitimate requests for advice versus free consulting* draw the hard line between fee based consultation and free advice, and make it stick * keep job interviews from turning into surprised brain picking sessions (who hasn’t gone through that before!)* manage habitual brain pickers * communicate your message with people so they understand what they get for free and for fee (and be OK with it)* remove the guilt from charging what your worth* establish your fees (and get them)* balance volunteer/philanthropic giving and paying clients* and more This book is for anyone who:* has a service business* is a service professional* is always the “go to” man or woman by friends and family members* is uncomfortable setting fees and rates* has difficulty saying “no” to people who want to get endless freebies because they feel entitled* needs to differentiate between consulting and advice* is tired of being taken advantage of and not compensated* wants to sincerely balance giving freely and selling ""You’re in business to make money. Some people will tell you this is the wrong attitude, but I tell you it’s the right attitude to help you stay in business. There is nothing wrong with giving free advice to people who genuinely need it or to flex your knowledge in an interview to show you know your stuff. But it’s not OK for someone to keep coming back expecting you to hand them a finished blueprint or do their work for them without any compensation. Your knowledge is valuable. YOU are valuable. Stop letting others take advantage of you. Learn to control how, when and to whom you give free advice to.""Adrienne Graham"

280,B00LMH118K,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LMH118K,Crowdfunding: The Winning Formula: How to Raise Money For A Business That Works For You,2.99,"CrowdFunding: The Next Big Thing – The Winning FormulaIn CrowdFunding: The Winning Formula money-raising expert Gary Spirer reveals the timeless secret of raising capital and building fabulous wealth. The Secret was given to him by his mentor, Andre Meyer, the senior partner of the prestigious investment banking firm Lazard Frères and one of the wealthiest men in the world of his time.   Contrary to many investment bankers Meyer was publicity-shy, even if he was an advisor to the Kennedy family and a lifelong friend and advisor to Jackie Onassis“At Lazard, André Meyer organized SOVAC (Societé pour la Vente à Crédit d'Automobiles), a finance company that in the late twenties introduced the concept of automobile financing for consumers. It made Lazard Frères a significant force in consumer credit as well as in product leasing. André Meyer, called ""the most creative financial genius of our time in the investment banking world"" by David Rockefeller, became one of the most important people in American business with an influence that extended around the globe. Known as ""The Picasso of Banking,"" he introduced innovative financing techniques to post-War American business. During the 1960s, Meyer was responsible for making Lazard Frères the top mergers and acquisitions (M&A) firm in the U.S. He put together prodigious deals through leveraged buy outs for companies such as International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) who grew to become the ninth largest industrial corporation in the United States.” (Wikipedia).Spirer explains how Meyer’s Secret was counter intuitive-the opposite of what 99% of the population follows. The Secret is what the top 1% and top 1% of 1% know and implement. Spirer relates that he felt similar to Napoleon Hill who was told the secret to wealth by Andrew Carnegie.  That secret became the basis for Hill’s best-selling business book ever called Think and Grow Rich. Inspired by Napoleon Hill, Andrew Carnegie and Andre Meyer, Spirer has spent 30 years studying the most successful people in the world and creating a system of principles, models and strategies that accelerate success and wealth building.  He founded a softeware called DilogR to implement all these strategies, models and principles. Spirer advances his belief expressed in his best-selling book Crowdfunding: The Next Big Thing that crowdfunding -raising money online (like the TV program  Shark Tank goes online) will revolutionize money raising, business building and wealth creationIn Crowdfunding the Winning Formula Spirer shows that crowdfunding is a platform made possible thanks to the recent JOBS Act. Spirer guides readers through the seven steps that any start-up business can employ to ensure success in raising money and building a business. Spirer points out that too many entrepreneurs believe that if you build a field of dreams they will come. He believes that entrepreneurs focus too much on what they feel customers want rather than truly finding out by in-field interviews and online testing. With a great idea and design, a start-up needs to thoroughly and repeatedly research and pre-test its product in the marketplace until the ideal niche is narrowed down in order to attract the most customers. He explains how to work with today’s savvy consumers, who expect to be part of the marketing conversation. Spirer's book shares the secrets that venture capitalists have employed to identify potential blockbuster investments and how the same approaches can be deployed in analyzing crowdfunding opportunities."

If so, then no one would be more surprised than bird man John James Audubon himself, who feared that he would die unknown.Today his name is recognized all around the world, but during his own lifetime he was just another man with a dream that nobody wanted to support. His dream was to publish a series of bird books which featured his life-like bird sketches, so that all the world could know birds as he did.People told him he wasn't good enough. They cheated him, ignored him, and did everything in their power to discourage him. In spite of the obstacles he pushed forward, sometimes working in temperatures so cold that his fingers could barely hold a pencil to draw. He slept outdoors on the ground when he couldn't afford to pay for lodging, and he performed gruesome and disgusting jobs to earn money.Audubon was a self-published author in the 1800s, and publishing was a daunting task in those days. Out of his own pocket he hired editors, printers, engravers, colorists, and then had to convince people to buy his books without the ease of internet communication. Selling a book was harder than publishing it. Even in his day the people with the most money expected to get the books for free, books that he had to pay to have printed.His story is for everyone with a dream. The next time you're feeling doom and gloom, wondering if you should give up your dreams, let the incredible story of Audubon uplift you. He overcame seemingly insurmountable odds, pushed forward when all hope seemed lost, and not only achieved comfortable success, but left a scientific legacy that spans the entire world and still lives on long after his death.Non-fiction, short story."

290,B00GI51YFG,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GI51YFG,How I Organize My Money: The Budgeting Secrets of a Lazy Do-it-Yourselfer,2.99,"This love-it or hate-it eBook presents one man’s unorthodox approach to personal budgeting.After years of struggling with traditional budgeting methods, Todd A. Swart developed a method of organizing money that virtually eliminates the need to keep track of his spending. Following the age-old wisdom of envelope budgeting, Todd separates his income into a network of bank accounts and cash categories, each one carefully designed to handle a different aspect of his personal finances. In How I Organize My Money, Todd presents a detailed breakdown of his unique budgeting system.Written in a conversational, first person perspective, ""How I Organize My Money"" offers the reader an inside look into one man’s unconventional budgeting methods. If you are ready to discover a fresh approach to personal budgeting, this is the book for you.Here’s Todd talking about the importance of having a good budgeting system:Most budgets are set up completely backwards. They are designed to track money after it has been spent. This means that constant effort and discipline are required in order for them to work.My system eliminates the need to track spending. Instead, I use a highly detailed organizational structure that separates and defines all the different parts of my money. This structure shows me at a glance how much is available in each spending and savings category. There is no tracking involved... no software... just a simple, elegant system. A good budgeting system is like the engine of a car. It puts power at your fingertips with only a small amount of effort on your part. There are three reasons my budgeting system works so well. These reasons make my system different from almost every other budget out there. Those reasons are:Reason #1) The budgeting method I use actually organizes your money. This is something that spreadsheets and software cannot do. The best those tools can do is give you an inventory of your money. They do nothing to organize the money itself. My budgeting system is built on solid organizational principles. Just like an organized closet or garage can make home life easier, organizing your money will greatly improve your financial world.Reason #2) My budgeting system doesn't rely on discipline or motivation. I know from experience that I would never stick to a budget that required me to constantly track my spending. To avoid this tedious chore, I built a system that requires only a minimal involvement on my part. With my budgeting system, I can honestly say that I spend no more that about 10 minutes per week managing my budget.Reason #3) My budgeting system creates boundaries. A good organizational system defines the boundaries of all the different parts of your money. These boundaries have a powerful effect on the way you think about and use your money. Once the boundaries are defined, it is easy and natural to make good spending decisions in virtually every situation.A good organizational system removes the clutter from your financial world. It lets you think more clearly about your money and helps you make better money decisions. In “How I Budget Without Spreadsheets or Software”, you will see the exact system I use to control my income with confidence, ease, and authority.Sincerely,Todd A. SwartP.S.

My budgeting methods are so simple a child can understand them, and yet they are sophisticated enough to handle even complex financial situations. Click the ‘Buy Now’ button to order."
291,B00AJBLGV2,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AJBLGV2,The Complete Libertarian Forum,6.99,"It's finally here, the digital edition of the Libertarian Forum that serious collectors and readers only dreamed about a few years ago. Those who were lucky enough to have the complete set held onto them for dear life. After all, their value was legendary: the Libertarian Forum, edited by Murray N. Rothbard from 1969 to 1984, had a small, even tiny, circulation but it forged the intellectual edifice known as libertarianism. Month after month, the newsletter thrilled, enlightened, shocked, and awed its subscribers. Everything was on the table. And here are all the issues again, as smart, gossipy, and fresh as they were when they were first written. This was where Murray wrote his extraordinary movie reviews, his searing political commentary on everything from Nixon, Carter, and Reagan to the New Left and the New Right, and his contemporary history of the libertarian movement, from the founding of the Libertarian Party to the implosion of the movement in the 1980s. It is all bracing, fun, controversial, and fire hot. As the saying goes, he was just one man with a typewriter, but he changed the world. The appearance of this incredible newsletter in ebook form brings joy to the heart. Murray would be exuberantly happy to see it all on his Kindle!  Making them available was originally Walter Block's idea. Initially it seemed impossible. We didn't have all issues. The costs would be prohibitive. The volumes would be too thick and unwieldy. Would their content still be relevant?  Once we began to look carefully at this treasure, it was clear that it had to be done.It is still huge: 1202 print pages! But we put it into eBook format and it is now truly manageable. And thanks to donors who also saw the need, and the many people who worked to find copies and send them to us, we put together an entire set, and now they are all available to make another huge dent in the history of the world.It was a miracle publication in many ways—something that would never have been published by a mainstream house. It existed from 1969 to 1984. It was a passionate, smart, gossipy, and often shocking newsletter that is as fresh today as when it was written. It was low circulation but it exercised huge influence. It gave birth to the libertarian movement, raised it through its infancy and teen years, and gave it a farewell once it entered adulthood.If you think libertarian ideas are marginal today, imagine what it was like in the 1970s. This body of ideas that consistently championed liberty in all its forms had been banished from the world of ideas. But Rothbard's newsletter set out to change that. It quickly became the publication you had to read to understand the movement and the world, and it had a hand in shaping both. You will see many names that you recognize (Murray wasn't the only writer), and hear the details on subjects in libertarian history about which you have heard only rumors. You will discover how a brilliant intellectual read and understood the daily news from a radical libertarian perspective. In short, if you want to understand modern libertarianism—or even modern politics—these volume are not only essential; they are a priceless and indispensable resource."

Driving the cars you like, minus the expense and depreciation by letting them pay for it!It all started when I found myself trying to keep my family in cars, as my daughters were now getting older and getting their drivers license. I needed to replace my own car, as well as my wife’s car. This was adding up to serious money and the depreciation was going to kill me. So much of our purchasing is done within the realm of “consuming”. That means we make a purchase based either in want or need, but the item loses its value quickly and slips from the asset column over time and remains in the debit column of our balance sheet.

Stevens is in the top 1% of earners, yet has nothing to show for it.  At 60 years old, and because of a lifetime of spending stupidly, he is in real trouble.  He can barely pay next month’s bills, and he cannot retire.  How can a smart business executive be so blinded and dumb when it comes to personal financial management and spending?Through his book, Still Stupid at Sixty, Stevens reviews his life.  He identifies the demons that have blinded and deluded him, causing him to spend too much and never putting anything away for a rainy day.  He relives and analyses his spending habits, and shares the lessons learned so you can avoid making similar mistakes.  Stevens shows that, no matter how much you make, you will never be in a position to retire unless you get your spending under control.  This book describes the consequences of the author’s stupidity through a number of (sometimes humorous) anecdotes and explains the reasons of how an otherwise smart man can be so stupid when it comes to spending. It further explores how we fail to see clearly about this in our own lives, and offers simple things we can do to correct and avoid the problems that Stevens now faces.If you feel you never earn enough and earning a little more would correct all your problems, then Stevens’ story will show you that making more money is not the answer.   Entertainers and sports figures who have earned hundreds of millions of dollars still have problems.  Still Stupid at Sixty is a fascinating read about why we get into trouble by spending too much, and how to get out and stay out of trouble.  If you can’t seem to turn the corner no matter how much you make, then this could be the book to help you do that."

352,B00D5HA4G0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D5HA4G0,Making a Real business as a Fiverr Seller: Fiverr for the Internet Marketer,0.99,"Most books about Fiverr will give you tips for funny, lively, creative gigs. Their job is to entertain you and to find new ways that you can amuse yourself and amaze your friends, and generally they do that very well. You will be singing little tunes while hanging upside down in your skivvies, telling jokes underwater while holding a sign or juggling a chainsaw while you yell a commercial message (don’t try that one, please). The unsaid assumption is that you will have a lot of fun and make money from these gigs. Sadly, the last part, the one about making money, is simply not true. The funny gigs are thoroughly, dismally unprofitable. In fact, all the manual Fiverr gigs are worthless, at least so far as making money. I will cover a few of these too, including some of the very best manual gigs in Fiverr, and then show you with plain facts and figures why they are so dismal and why you should stay away from them. There are plenty of gig ideas in this book, none of them funny. This book is about using Fiverr to make money, so these are all business ideas; ideas about services and products that you can sell in Fiverr. The basic concept behind these gigs is that a good, profitable gig is one in which you will be selling five minutes of your time for $5, because these are all gigs that can be automated. Do the math yourself to see what kind of hourly rate that is. The keys to making decent money as a Fiverr seller are finding profitable niches, arming yourself with the right tools and then finding ways to promote your gigs, and that is what this book is all about.There are three business models that work well in Fiverr: Automated Gigs, Gigs where you sell PLR and Gigs where you sell Physical Items. In this book I cover all three business models in detail, telling you what to sell, where to sell it and how to find what you are going to sell, how to present it to your buyers and how to promote your gigs."

Although good jobs I felt stuck and confused.I turned to career counseling, but that only revealed what I'd always known - that my strengths lay in more interpersonal and creative fields. Unfortunately this career guidance didn't help me at all; it only intensified my frustration and feeling of being stuck. I had no clue as to how to make a change and make my dreams come true.Today, as a group facilitator and career coach, I observe the very same phenomenon with many of my clients: they have an idea of what they want to do, but something restrains them from moving forward.That ""something"" is namely: fear, low self-esteem, anger and guilt.In other words: conscious and unconscious emotions drive our career choices.The truth is that knowledge and talent alone aren't enough to succeed!Self-realization and success go hand-in-hand with a cleansing of negative feelings (such as resentment, anger, guilt and grief), high self-esteem and the determination to realize your career aspirations despite obstacles along the way.In this guide I share insights and tools I have acquired in my own process of career-change - from my position as a marketing and administration employee to managing my own business in writing, group career counseling and career/personal coaching. I also provide case studies of my clients and others who traveled this very same path - the path of transformation from a sense of being emotionally stuck to professional breakthrough.The book Finding Your Career Path without Losing Your Mind is divided into eight chapters: love, happiness, self-esteem, fear, disappointment, anger, grief, and guilt. It offers explanations, case studies, tools and tips on how to tackle difficult emotions and how to cultivate positive ones along the way to personal realization and career development.Whether you are looking for a new job, building a new business or need a better work-life balance, this book is for you.If you too want to escape from the emotional loop and give yourself a real chance to succeed, I invite you to give this book a try. It will help you dig up hidden treasures within yourself and emerge as you are meant to be: creative, vibrant, and determined. It will directly impact your career and your quality of life."

373,B00BA1UK26,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BA1UK26,Legitimate Leadership,9.99,"Legitimate Leadership, written by Wendy Lambourne, essentially looks at what every employer strives for but often gives up on: attaining the willingness of employees at work.Lambourne is a partner at Schuitema Human Excellence Group, which works extensively among South African blue-chip companies and throughout the world. It has major clients in the UK, USA and Asia.The conclusion of the book is somewhat surprising: employees’ willingness at work is not a direct  “deliverable”  of, for instance, improving work conditions or remuneration. Rather it is a byproduct of the personal relationship which those in command positions at work have with those who report to them.Specifically, willingness at work arises only when those in charge strive for the very best in their people, care for them sincerely and help them to grow,  with no payback agenda in mind.The seminal research supporting the above contention comes from the South African gold mining industry in the 1980s. The initial insights from this research have been validated, by the work done by Wendy Lambourne and her colleagues, in diverse contexts all over the world in the past 20 years.These insights have, moreover, gained special validity in post-Marikana South Africa. This is because, while remuneration and physical conditions on mines have improved in recent decades, the personal relationship between managers and those who report to them at all levels have remained poor or deteriorated.But Legitimate Leadership is not a theoretical discourse on management-employee relations. It is rather a  practical guide on implementing legitimate leadership using the Care and Growth criteria  drawing on examples from an impressive range of organizational contexts. No similar principle–based but usable advice to leaders currently exists.The book is aimed at business owners and managers who are concerned with successfully leading others and transforming both others and themselves in the process."

408,B00I0IE5OG,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I0IE5OG,How to Prioritize Your Project Portfolio Using Conteneo Collaboration Games: A Playbook in the Epic Wins Series,2.99,"This playbook is intended for senior leaders who want to create better business results when prioritizing a project portfolio, for portfolio managers who are frustrated by the limits of ROI analysis, and anyone who thinks that current approaches to picking the best projects aren’t working. It’s for people like Sallee Peterson, Senior VP Global Customer Support at VeriSign, who faced a seemingly intractable problem: She had asked her global team of nearly 200 support representatives to submit ideas on how to improve customer service. She was pleased—and overwhelmed—with the results: After culling through the submissions, she and her leadership team identified 46 innovative projects. Unfortunately, they could only afford about six to ten projects. As Sallee explained, the traditional process would have been to simply have her leadership team pick the projects, explaining the selections to employees through a series of management briefings. But Sallee wanted to try something different: She wanted to engage her global team in selecting the best possible projects. She used a game plan from this project prioritization playbook enabling her team to collaboratively identify the top seven of the 46 projects. And that’s not all they achieved. The incredibly high degree of employee engagement in the process and their support of the resulting choices led Sallee to estimate that VeriSign saved more than three months of implementation time—a truly Epic Win. Created from more than a decade of experience working with Fortune 500 and other progressive organizations, the game plans described in this playbook show you how to harness the amazing power of collaborative play and serious games to prioritize your organization’s project portfolio. The result is your Epic Win: your project portfolio prioritized to both business objectives and customer needs with an organization motivated to implement the same. Using the game plans described in this playbook, you’ll be able to change stakeholder “me” perspectives to “we” perspectives. That’s because “winning” these game requires working with others, forming alliances, thinking strategically, and structured negotiations on the highest impact results for the company. Conteneo’s games enable employees to rise above organizational silos and think holistically about what is right for the company. The Conteneo collaboration games described in this playbook are fast and easy to play and scale to organizations of all sizes. They will enable you not only to choose the best projects for execution but also ensure that projects have the resources required for success. The book’s game plans focus on strategic, longer-term priorities along with tactical, near-term projects. The book includes a discussion of common challenges associated with traditional approaches to portfolio management and explains how to choose a game plan to eliminate those challenges and select the right plan for your company. It also includes guidelines for producing a successful game event and provides case studies of VeriSign, Hewlett-Packard, and Daimler Financial Services. No matter what your unique situation is, this playbook will show you a better way to prioritize your project portfolio that results in an Epic Win."

This world can involve strange new financial instruments, massive flows of money, and extremely lucrative compensation to its participants, all of which only add to the frustration that many feel when trying to understand this part of economy.Gordon S. Massie's book, ""The Whistleblower's Dilemma: Confronting Fraud at AIG"", tells the story of one man's rise and fall in this world of high finance. This is a human story that does not demand that readers have extensive backgrounds in business.

We think of the perpetrators and wonder:Who are the people who made these decisions?Did no one in these companies have enough decency to stand up and protest?This insider’s account of one of the most notorious financial institutions in history taps into our anger and frustration about the economy and helps us understand how deception and fraud can be so widely tolerated. Along the way it provides sharp and often scathing snapshots of the bloated egos that populate the business world, the rewards the industry lavishes on its leaders, and the devastating cost to anyone who dares questions the party line.This book has been professionally written, edited, and proofread."

422,B005HJ37FY,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HJ37FY,Common Cents: Economics+Politics+Finance A Citizen's Survival Guide,3.99,"""Change is inevitable. Change is constant.""        – Benjamin Disraeli""It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.""       – Charles DarwinEditorial SummaryThe world is changing. Fast. Economics, finance, politics. Revolutions in information, communication, economic liberalization, and political integration are bombarding us at a dizzying pace. Individually and collectively, we try to manage this change, seeking to adapt and thrive. One way we organize our collective action is through the exercise of public policy, but the landscape keeps changing and the old maps and blueprints seem inadequate to the task. If our leadership elites understand how to manage these changes, it is not apparent from the results. Regrettably, our traditional media sources seem unable or unwilling to help by providing straight answers untainted by ideology and political partisanship. The stock market jumps higher one day, and crashes the next, but what exactly has changed between yesterday and today? Or tomorrow? Meanwhile, Main Street enterprises and average families struggle to survive, much less thrive. In a self-governing democracy, how do we navigate this growing chaos? How do we return to a world we recognize?To start, we need to establish some touchstones to anchor our rational perceptions. Today, these touchstones must come from our own understanding. We need a basic intellectual foundation to guide our collective decisions because managing democracy is no longer the exclusive domain of the expert. Common Cent$: A Citizen’s Survival Guide hopes to satisfy this need. The guide is a basic primer that focuses on economics for non-economists and policymakers. Its author holds advanced degrees in economics, finance, and political science and has taught these disciplines at the university level. He has also worked in an investment management and consulting capacity. In contrast to conventional approaches, this guide offers a new way of understanding our society that departs from the economy as a mechanical system or programmable machine amenable to simple policy directives. Rather, the adopted metaphor is organic, holistic, and integrative. Our analysis focuses on resource inputs and outputs in a natural cycle over time. Rational, interactive human behavior becomes a key driver of this economic-financial-political ecosystem. In developing this approach, we can then tackle the nuts and bolts of the conventional policy world encompassing Federal Reserve monetary policy, the banking system, government fiscal policy, tax policy, public finance and social insurance entitlements. With a clearer perception as to how these various policies shape our world, we can gain a greater understanding of the ways we have been affected personally through the gyrations of the financial, housing, and labor markets. In this respect, we may discover that intuition is more powerful than technical expertise. This guide is not a compendium of solutions, but a framework for analysis so that we may design solutions together. Our financial and economic predicaments are not accidents of circumstance; we are not victims of fate. Our problems are of our own design due to misguided policies and faulty intellectual models of our world. The road back to sanity starts with small steps.

I believe the reason is to inspire others, not just with books but also with messages, seminars and training sessions that originate from someone who isn’t the usual suspect.  Sure, I’m successful, but the only way I know how to tell it is straight.  I speak it how I see it, and I’ve realized that while some may not be able to receive it, many more want to hear it. I know that if I can make it, anyone can. This book is about some of my experiences as a successful dentist and as a businesswoman.  It’s about my mindset and what lessons I learned along my journey. I believe I can help others overcome the hurdles that may line their path to success.  I hope it inspires you to be all you can be. As I’ve come to learn, the sky is just the beginning."

The same real estate marketing strategies that worked 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago, seem to change as quickly as the housing market.And with the good old days (or as I like to call them, 2005) long gone, realtors need to have a real estate marketing plan that's cheap, effective and flexible enough to move with the changing marketing landscape.And Facebook is the perfect vehicle for your real estate marketing efforts.I know, Facebook? You mean that annoying social network where people share every single thought that comes into their brain and barrage you with Mafia Wars invites?Yeah, that Facebook.Here's the thing: as realtors we aren't selling widgets or refrigerators or iPhone adapters. We are selling our experience, and our relationship with our clients. And when it comes to the touchy-feely world of marketing relationships nothing works quite as well as Facebook.As long as you do it right.Because there are so many ways to do it wrong.And that's why I wrote this book. To help other realtors struggling with:-What do I post?-When do I post?-How do I post?-How do I get fans?-How do I not waste my time with Facebook?I don't claim to be a total Facebook expert, but I do claim to have made every mistake in the book. (And hopefully learned a little something in the process.)And that's why I wrote ""Real Estate Marketing in the 21st Century Vol.2: Facebook Marketing for Realtors""So what do I cover in the book?Well...In Chapter 1: Yeah, But How Do I Make Money With Facebook?...I lay out a simple plan for turning all those fans and likes into actual leads and clients. (The method may surprise you.)In Chapter 2: 5 Biggest Fan-Page Mistakes Realtors Make...I show you the absolute top 5 things you gotta do when setting up your fan page, and how to absolutely crush the competition.In Chapter 3: The 3 Keys to Facebook Posting...I break down the when, what, and how of facebook posting with a simple, easy formula that even a congressman could follow.In Chapter 4: Custom Apps (Why They are your Best friend)...I explain how Facebook royally tries to screw us over as marketers, and how custom apps help you take back the power with focused little silos of lead-generating content.In Chapter 5: How to Get a Boatload of Fans...I show you...well...how to get a boatload of fans.In Chapter 6: Facebook Advertising for Realtors...I dig into my favorite types of Facebook ad types, and how to use them for top effectiveness. (And with as little cost as possible.)And lastly, in Chapter 7: How to Put Your Facebook Marketing on autopilot...i show you how to get other people to do all the work for you. (Yeah!)So, that's it! I've put everything I know about Facebook marketing for realtors into this book. Hopefully it gives you a good foundation for your Real estate marketing strategies and helps you make a whole lot of money!"

The visual.Positioning is a totally verbal concept. You build a brand by owning a word in the mind.Yet the best way into a mind is not with words at all. The best way into a mind is with visuals.But not any visual. You need a “visual hammer” that hammers a verbal nail. The Marlboro cowboy. Coca-Cola’s contour bottle. Corona’s lime.The cowboy hammers “masculinity.” The contour bottle hammers “authenticity.” The lime hammers “genuine Mexican beer.”A trademark is not a visual hammer. Almost every brand has a trademark, but fewer than one out of a hundred brands have a visual hammer. A trademark is a rebus which communicates nothing except the name of the brand. A visual hammer, on the other hand, communicates the essence of the brand. Visual Hammer is the first book to document the superiority of the “hammer and nail” approach to branding. Some examples.The pink ribbon that made Susan G. Komen for the Cure the largest nonprofit foundation to fight breast cancer.The Aflac duck that increased Aflac’s name recognition from 12 percent to 94 percent.The green jacket which made the Masters the most-prestigious golf tournament.The polo player which made Ralph Lauren the largest-selling high-end clothing brand.The bottle which made Absolut the largest-selling high-end vodka.The watchband which made Rolex the largest-selling luxury watch.The red soles which made Christian Louboutin the leading luxury-shoe brand.The chalice which made Stella Artois the fifth largest-selling imported beer.Colonel Sanders who made KFC the world’s largest chicken chain.Why are marketing plans usually nothing but words when the best way into a mind is with the emotional power of a visual?After reading Visual Hammer, you might want to tear up your current marketing plan and start fresh.The first edition of Visual Hammer was an ebook, published on Kindle in 2012. This is the second edition which was released in Paperback on April 23, 2015.Visual Hammer has also been translated into German, Chinese, Russian and Turkish."

472,B00IO5LTVC,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IO5LTVC,The New Rules of Customer Engagement: 6 Trends Reinventing The Way We Sell,7.95,"Imagine a world where you never had to sell anything…Every day the ideal number of clients with needs aligned perfectly to what you have to offer would walk through the door and shout:“I’ll take it!”What if I told you this is already happening? Albeit selling isn’t quite that simple. And the customers aren’t really just arriving sight unseen, ready to buy. But in a very subtle way, brands are driving buying decisions long before the sales department ever becomes involved.  This leaves us all to ask, how? Suppose it’s January 2nd 2014… picture yourself waking up in the New Year and deciding it’s time to buy a new car. What is the first thing you do? Perhaps you pick up the newspaper or PennySaver and see what special savings are being offered? Or maybe you hop in your car and drive from dealership to dealership looking for the best deal? You could do either. However, in today’s economy, it’s more likely you would do neither. Instead, you would take your iPad or Smartphone off the charger, head over to your sofa, put your feet up on the ottoman and start surfing. You would scroll through the car review sites; perhaps browse over to the carmakers’ webpages to explore what special offers and incentives they’re offering. Then, you would pop onto Facebook with one point of focus: to ask for your friends’ opinions on the car(s) that now – after thorough online research – earned a place on your short list. Without ever leaving the couch, you’ve determined:•Which car you want•What features are most attractive•The vehicle’s MSRP and invoice cost•The target price you’ll most likely pay•A trustworthy estimate of what your trade-in should be worth•Your most up-to-date credit score•The interest rate you’ll most likely pay on the car loan•The competitive lending site where you’ll prequalify for that loanFinally, in just a few short hours, you will walk into the dealership that seems to have the most appealing online presence and best customer service ratings. In your hand will be a printout of the vehicle you want, the value of your trade, the price, interest rate and a pre-approved loan. You will look at the guy in the yellow short-sleeved dress shirt and the plaid tie and you will say: “I’ll take it!”In an informed economy, this is the new way of doing business. And these are the new rules of customer engagement.This is more than just a trend. These new rules are already impacting everything transactional – not only how we as consumers buy things personally, but how businesses consume as well. B2B, B2C, P2P… it doesn’t matter.

Or have you been trained by a business coach who has taught you invaluable business skills but in the end, the results have scarcely changed? If so, than your predicament deals with lacking the most important business skill: communication. Complex techniques and skills are indeed very helpful in achieving business success, but without communication skills any technique or skill is irrelevant. Communicative ability is the foundation for each business technique and without it, any technique will most likely fail. When making decisions in the business world communication is of the utmost importance. How can a decision that a business makes be understood accurately without having the correct communication skills to present the decision clearly? The business' decision could be a straightforward path for success, but without communicative skills the path is ruined. A person may have the best product or service to offer, but if the person lacks communication skills the product or service will fail to sell. Many entrepenuers have overlooked the necessity of communication skills in order to learn more complex skills, but in truth, this neglect leads to instant failure. Yes other business techniques will create higher levels of success for a business, but effective communication is the key to all success."

Sunchaser""It will give you a clear picture of how to get the store of the ground. Especially for the non tech-savvy."" Matthew T. AaronThis course was created for anyone who wants to create a profitable web store. I’ve helped people with just an idea, people with existing businesses and people who need to find their idea. It’s all covered in this course. This book doesn’t cover topics about raising money, perfecting your investor pitch or going the venture fund route. I started my first site with $50 as a test, and therefore I make some assumptions:•You don’t have $5 million of investor funds sitting in your bank account •You’re unable to relocate to the handful of startup hubs in the world •You’re unwilling to work 70-hour weeks for low pay with the hope of someday making millions from stock options There’s nothing wrong with going the start-up route with venture funding and attempting to grow fast like Google, Twitter and Facebook. But that isn’t the focus of this book. What Does This Book Cover? This book will give you the tools you need to build and launch a successful online store. This process includes: •Developing the success mindset for launching your business •Finding and testing a niche market •Finding profitable products to sell online•How to set up your online store•Choosing the optimal platform, price and revenue model •Building a killer sales website •Understanding the primary purpose of your sales website•How to set up the business legally•Step-by-step on how to build your store•How to attract customers to your online store •Optimizing your site for search engines•Managing customer service•Learning how to outsource As I began writing, I looked around at the other available courses. What I found were bits and pieces, weak filler material from those selling the dream of the internet lifestyle. There is very little practical guidance out there and no real blueprint for the process. So that’s what I’ve focused on providing a practical, step-by-step approach to getting your online store launched in the fastest time possible.Table of ContentsIntroductionSection 1: Finding Your NichePart 1-1: Advantages and Costs of Online Business Part 1-2: 5 Easy Steps to Finding Your MarketPart 1-3: Your NichePart 1-4: The 3 Step Process to Finding your NicheSection 2: Finding the Products You Want to SellPart 2-1: The Retail Chain ProcessPart 2-2: Approaching VendorsPart 2-3: Overseas Manufacturers Direct BuysSection 3: Setting Up Your Web StorePart 3-1: Open Source Shopping Cart vs. Hosted Shopping Cart Part 3-2: Selecting Your Shopping CartPart 3-3: Web Host & Domain NamePart 3-4: SSL CertificatesPart 3-5: Merchant Account SolutionsPart 3-6: The Best Look for Your Online BusinessPart 3-7: Skills You Need to Build A Unique Online Store Part 3-8: Pages to Include in Your WebsiteSection 4: Pricing Your ProductsPart 4-1: Charging Premium PricesPart 4-2: Commanding Top DollarPart 4-3: Am I Not Charging Enough?Part 4-4: Enhancing the Perception of ValuePart 4-5: Competitors Underselling the Same Products as YouSection 5: Customer Service and Your Online ReputationPart 5-1: Knowing What Customers Really Want Part 5-2: Don’t Make Your Customers Angry Part 5-3: Customer Service DisastersPart 5-4: Reducing ReturnsPart 5-5: Reducing Unnecessary Support Calls Part 5-6: Customer Support with Little to No Staff Part 5-7: How to Handle Credit Card Charge BacksFinal Tips for Starting Your Business11 Simple Methods to Effectively Eliminate RiskWhen Launching Your Online Company You Made It!E-commerce Glossary"

504,B00EOWZTN8,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EOWZTN8,Betting Against America: What The 1% Does In The Cayman Islands And How To Fight Back,9.95,"Were you, or someone you know, affected by the Financial Crisis of 2008?  Wonder what the 1% does with their enormous wealth?  Do you feel like the game might be rigged?   If you answered ‘yes’ to any of these questions, then new author Elliott Bringman’s ""Betting Against America"", is a must read!   While the 2012 US Presidential Election brought to light Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s Cayman Islands accounts, nobody was able to dig deeper into what these accounts actually do.  Based upon his extensive time working around offshore hedge funds for the Bank of New York Mellon, Bringman’s ""Betting Against America"" goes where others have not.   Bringman utilizes his insider knowledge to show how the nation’s financial elite used offshore accounts during the financial crisis to buffer themselves from the disastrous policies they openly promote.Through risky “Global Macro” investment strategies, banks such as BNY Mellon and Goldman Sachs have turned Planet Earth into one big gambling platform, where those with the means to do so can place bets for or against global winners and losers respectively.  Bringman argues that those in power can now make money off of their policies, regardless of how disastrous it might be for the rest of us, by simply knowing how to play the capital markets.  While BNY Mellon touted they created a financial “unsinkable ship,” Bringman shows how the 2008 Financial Crisis would prove to be the Achilles’ Heel for Global Macro.  “Global Alpha,” as the strategy was marketed, found itself not only in the hedge fund accounts of folks like BNY Mellon CEO Robert Kelly, but also as part of the retirement portfolios of those drawing benefits from some of the United States’ largest public and private pensions.  Far from protecting investors from the risk associated with the global financial markets, Bringman illustrates how these derivative-based funds actually amplified it. With five years having passed since the devastating Financial Crisis of 2008, the United States finds itself again riding yet another bubble.  The Dow is hovering around all-time highs and the real estate market is beginning to heat up.  More than just diagnosing the problem, Betting Against America offers readers suggestions for those asking what they can do to protect themselves when the current bubble bursts."
505,B0043EV968,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0043EV968,Going Green with Electric Cars - Energy Policy or Just Sexy?,1.35,"This short book is an overview of how our electricity is currently generated, and alternative technologies for generating clean power. The focus is on the impact of a new class of automobiles, the electric car, on oil consumption, greenhouse gases, and the electric power grid. The reason for focusing on the electric car is because these cars have captured much attention recently, and digging into the impact of the electric car is a great opportunity to learn a bit about the complex topic of the future of energy.The author, Bernie Landoz is not an energy expert. He is an investor and a lobbyist of sorts. But his position requires him to understand a variety of industries, one of which is the future of energy and the newest technologies in energy, which include the electric car and the smart power grid. Investors and lobbyists often end up knowing more than the experts about what's strategically important, because their focus is on breadth, not depth (i.e. the big picture).Bernie illustrates his analysis based on industry data and his insight as an investor and lobbyist. He is using data from a variety of sources, and shares that data, but he emphasizes that his main point is not debating the fine details of the data. His focus is providing a reasonably accurate picture of the future of energy, and its relationship to automobiles, for the purposes of discussing energy policy and as input to an investment strategy for these new technologies.This book is also an opportunity to understand how a large-scale investor and lobbyist thinks. More information about Bernie is available at www.bernielandoz.com."

Now the series, with more background and other information, has been compiled in a newly released book, Farm Hands: Hard work and hard lessons from Western New York fields.Rivers worked at a dozen farms in Orleans and Genesee counties, trying to find out why so few local residents are willing to work on farms. He discovered the work requires many skills, enormous willpower and physical strength.Rivers knew the jobs would be hard, but he didn’t realize just how grueling. He also didn’t expect the workers to help him get through the difficult work days.  Rivers, 35, lost 40 pounds in 2008, and whipped himself into good enough shape to run a marathon. He compared that 26.2-mile run with cabbage cutting, and declared the farm work far more exhausting.The newspaper series, which the book is adapted from, won national honors from the North American Agricultural Journalists and Columbia Journalism School. The Associated Press also recognized the series for “in-depth reporting” and the New York Agricultural Society presented Rivers with a “golden pitchfork” for the project."

This book, How Relationship Selling Rewards Small Businesses, can change that view for you as it is all about loving your customers. Relationship selling means serving them by selling them your products and services to solve their problem or fulfill their desired need. With heart centered selling, you delay “selling” to listen first. Learn how to open your heart in selling to build stronger customer relationships. Focus initially on learning their concerns. You only present your products and services after you know and understand what they want and feel they need. Your goal is to build a relationship where they know they can trust your advice. They see you as more of a partner to help them fix what they need fixed or to deliver a desired result. They recognize that you really care, that while you sell products and services, they are people first, wallets second.If your business is based on caring for and serving your customers, on building long term relationships, train your sales people to use a relationship selling approach to sales. Customers make decisions about you and your business based on how your employees represent you. Relationship selling is sometimes also called soft sell to contrast it with hard sell, the more traditional way to train sales people. Few types of work are as a potentially rewarding as sales, in income, job satisfaction and personal success or fulfillment, especially for sales people who excel at heart centered, relationship selling. There is more to success in life and business than just the money. Connecting with prospects, customers and clients adds a deeply satisfying dimension to life. Serving others by helping them buy makes selling fun, fulfilling and mutually rewarding. And the sales come because customers love buying from people they trust."

532,B004GHNDUW,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004GHNDUW,The Sanctuary Movement: How Broken Immigration Policies Affect Cities,0.00,"The current debate over immigration policy in the United States divides political parties and individuals alike. Both sides would agree that the immigration system is broken. Evidence of this systematic failure is glaring: there are twelve million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, the federal government lacks a comprehensive enforcement and naturalization strategy, and sanctuary cities have been created to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.Cities such as Chicago and San Francisco have limited ability to deal with immigration issues, yet have acted to protect their citizens from deportation. By providing services to undocumented residents, cities have been forced to live with the consequences of an inadequate federal response to an issue that the Constitution delegates to the federal government. With a more sensible immigration strategy in place, there would be no need for sanctuary cities.This book explores the sanctuary city movement in detail. First, we will look at the life of an undocumented immigrant that came to America and now lives in a sanctuary city. Next, we will explore the history of immigration in the United States, how federal policy has changed over time, and how cities have responded to these changes. Finally, we will consider two examples of sanctuary cities: Chicago and San Francisco."

544,B00BD636RO,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BD636RO,Serious Traffic: Grow Your Income by Growing Your Audience,4.95,"Since 2009, over at the website I run called Think Traffic, we’ve worked to answer one simple question: “why do some websites and blogs become massively popular, while the vast majority go almost completely unnoticed?”Website “traffic” (in other words how many people visit your website) is elusive for most people. There are hundreds of millions of websites and blogs in existence, but only a tiny percentage of those will ever attract more than a handful of visitors.But for the sites that do become popular, the recipe is actually very simple. We’ve learned this from interviewing dozens of successful entrepreneurs and from publishing over 450 articles on the subject at Think Traffic.We’ve also learned the recipe for growing a popular site by growing Think Traffic to over 200,000 monthly visitors in under three years.Our approach to growing the site has been fairly straightforward. No tricks, no “secret” tactics, never anything black hat, and no paid advertising.Here’s our basic recipe for growing an audience online (please tell the social media gurus and SEO salesmen that it really is this simple). Every week we:Focus on writing extremely useful content whenever possibleMeet and interact with readers (we read and reply to every email we receive, and pay special attention to reader feedback)Connect with other bloggers (through interviews and over email and Skype) and praise people publicly when we love the work they do (this is great for building karma and getting linked back to and shared)Give people a clear reason and easy way to subscribe for email updates (and make RSS, Twitter, Facebook and everything else secondary)Show up, set goals, work hard, challenge ourselves and try new thingsThat’s really about it.Of course, in the beginning you also need to establish a killer foundation by choosing a great topic, making a case for why your site is worth paying attention to, delivering results, and developing a good looking and functional site.Once all that is in place, you have to resist the urge to tweak your site every day. Set your site up and refine your topic by listening and interacting with your audience, but then give it some time to work.We didn’t update our site’s layout and design for over two years. What we had served us well and we knew it was good enough to make our message shine.Show up, set goals, work hard, and challenge yourself.Focus on producing great content, connecting with bloggers/writers/entrepreneurs, and growing your army of supporters.Don’t overcomplicate things. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you things should be complicated. Building a following really is straightforward.You’ll hear this simple strategy over and over again throughout this book. We’ll dive deeper into each of the main components, and you’ll learn how to apply this strategy (and the simple tactics to support it) at your own site.We hope by the end of this book you’ll have a clear vision for making your own site as popular as you need or want to."

The black market accounts for 23% of the global GDP. The vast majority of the global black market is currently conducted in cash, but a new slate of anonymous cryptocurrencies offers to give greater speed and security to black market transactions.

The future looks bright for anonymous cryptocurrencies.Anonymous Cryptocurrencies is the first and most comprehensive book published about the emerging space of anonymous currencies. The book starts with the global trends pushing up the valuation of these altcoins, including the growth of the global black market, countercyclicality of the black market and hedging ability of these currencies, and the rise of darknet marketplaces and online gambling.

And if you have crafting skills, you can use them to  bring an income that makes a difference to you, just as this author did when both she and her husband found themselves out of work at the same time.In ""How to Create an Income from Home with a Successful and Profitable Etsy Shop"" seller Rebecca Galardo (freehippie) tells you exactly what she did to create an income from home with very basic skills.  Rebecca tells you how you can - with little to no experience selling items online - make at least a part-time income with your own products.  Rebecca provides you with shortcuts and tips that can make your selling in the handmade market that much easier: *Increase your customer base*Keep your creativity flowing*Create a shop (or shape the one you have) to attract YOUR loyal customer base*Avoid the BIGGEST and most prevalent mistake that Etsy Shop Owners (even the SUCCESSFUL ONES) make with customers.*Create lifetime customer loyalty with ease and increase repeat buyers.*Simple Shipping & Packaging*Basics in getting your store's name out (marketing) for little to NO money! People love to buy handmade and no matter what you make if it’s a product people want, you can learn from this book.  Rebecca Galardo started on Etsy from scratch and learned the hard way.  As a seller who became a full-time Etsian not from choice but from necessity, she had to make it work.  Now she wants to help other sellers to create the same (or better) success.  Because she wants to help others in the same situation she was in, she's priced this book to help ANYONE who wants to make their Etsy shop successful.Amazon.co.uk REVIEWS""This is a fantastic book with some great tips for newbies opening up their stores. I have taken some of these tips on board and my sales have increased.""  - Mrs. Tracey Kelly""I purchased this book to download to my android, to add to my collection of reference books, ideal for when on the move. And I'm very pleased I did. Rebecca Galardo writes in a pleasing down to earth manner. Step by step information, not only to do with Etsy, but also various blog sites on how to get your business out there in. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.""-Hedgewitch""In my opinion there can be nobody better placed to write a book like this one than someone who has actually created and runs their own successful Etsy shop as it is not just theory, it is experience and wisdom being imparted.When I bought this book I wanted to know what I needed to do to create my own shop, how to make it stand out and how the Etsy environment differed from other online selling environments like eBay and Amazon. The book told me everything I needed to know and more. The author imparts her experiences (both good and bad) in a conversational, easy to read manner and each chapter ends with a check list of things that you should have gained knowledge of within that chapter. I found this to be an excellent system as it prompted me to re-read the parts that needed to sink in more.This is NOT a recipe book claiming ""Do this and you will be successful"", it is an honest and open account of what the author did to make HER shop successful from which you can take pointers and advice and apply them to your shop.An excellent read with excellent advice. I am glad I bought it."" - Clactonite"

Millions of credit cards are compromised every day online and the truth is - no one is really safe. People have lost thousands and some millions at the hands of online scammers and hackers who have mastered the art of scamming by using various methods, which are discussed extensively in this Scam proof shopping Guide. What makes matters worse is the fact that more than half of the people who are scammed are not aware of the scams or have no idea that they have been hacked (not even when they receive their bills). This is why it is important to always take the necessary precautions when shopping online in order to avoid being scammed knowingly or unknowingly. Do not think just because you’ve shopped a million times online before then you are safe – no you are not! Just like a car accident, it takes one moment to become a victim of cyber crime. Chances are you’ve already been scammed once or twice before and you don’t know about it.  Truth is there are a number of articles and guides that offer safety tips for shopping online and if you have the time you can spend the next week or two to search and read them one by one. Alternatively (and more recommended) download this book instantly and within minutes you will have all the information you will ever need to stay safe online (at least for the next 12 months until new scamming methods are discovered). Within the next hour you should have the entire armory you need to avoid falling prey of the unscrupulous scammers, hackers and untrustworthy sites online. This comprehensive online shopping safety guide offers information about credit card safety, spotting fake sites and keeping phishers at bay. It is exactly what you need as we are excitedly headed for the Christmas shopping season. Yes! This Safe shopping Guide offers online holiday shopping safety tips as well. It is structured around 10 safety tips for shopping online but you will also find additional information about general practices to stay safe while surfing the internet. The last chapter contains some action steps you should be using every day. You are probably utilizing just one out of all the ones listed there.  Don’t expect a course about how to shop online (it is so easy you do not need a book for that) or a list of best sites to shop from (these change every now and then) rather expect useful information about credit card security advice, Online security and payment systems, online security breaches and certification and online shopping safety precautions to take to avoid becoming a victim. We will teach you the methods to apply when checking any site in existence online. Our goal is to provide you with a quick win formula you can start using two hours from now.

618,B00JEN10EE,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JEN10EE,Don't Give Your Work Away For Free,0.00,"Today’s traditional employment model is structured so that one is paid for the work he or she does over a given period. In this linear construct, you go to work for a week and at week’s end you are compensated for that work. The next week you do more work and are compensated for that work, and so on. This is a common agreement between employers and employees in many countries, including the United States. The purpose of this book is to challenge that construct. It is the author's intent to suggest a more profitable arrangement for the creator of the product — the worker. The notion is that one could work on a project for a certain amount of time but the product of that project could pay dividends for a longer term. One might work for a week and be paid for the product of that work every week for many years. Imagine how this construct would compound income week after week, project after project. At some point, with numerous streams of income from a growing number of completed projects, one would be able to discontinue taking on new projects if he or she desired, living off the residuals of the projects he or she created to that point. Indeed, one could take a vacation, still earning income from work he or she completed long ago.With the help of Dr. Frederick Von Greensburg, Thaddeus Cooper breaks down the concept of passive income and outlines a strategy for creating streams of this revenue to supplement or replace traditional income.A self-help book for the masses and a manifesto for the most creative among us, Don't Give Your Work Away For Free: A free ebook by Thaddeus Cooper is a MUST READ!"

630,B008QZHEAU,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008QZHEAU,From Office Hell to Yoga Heaven: Jumpstart Your Career as a Yoga Instructor,5.95,"ABOUT THE BOOKIn many ways, yoga saved my life.Most yoga practitioners can probably relate to that statement. Through yoga, self-transformation occurs throughout your lifetime in multiple spheres - body, mind, and spirit - to ultimately and continually bring you more in tune with yourself.I realized fairly early on in my yoga-life that I wanted less time in my cubicle at work, and more time on my mat. Back then, I wasn't really sure how I would make that a reality. Now, about a decade later, I teach internationally, I represent Nike as their one and only Global Yoga Ambassador, I'm sponsored by various brands that I really believe in, and I'm blessed with the opportunity to share my journey with you here.I wholeheartedly believe that you can make anything happen for yourself. I believe that you can - and must - seek to discover and live your passion. My yoga practice initiated and established this pathway for me, and I hope my story and my thoughts will inspire you to find the same for yourself.ABOUT THE AUTHORLeah Kim graduated from UCLA with a degree in Economics, but it wasn't long before she realized her life would be much better spent on the mat than in a cubicle. With the guidance of her first mentor Ally Hamilton, she has devoted her life to yoga, and has had the privilege of regularly practicing with many internationally recognized teachers while living for nearly a decade in the modern-day yoga mecca of Santa Monica.Since the spring of 2009, Leah has been Nike’s Global Yoga Ambassador. She travels on behalf of Nike’s yoga program as their spokesperson and head trainer. She leads Nike Training Club Yoga events, designs yoga programs for Nike, and is featured in Nike media publications. She is currently based in London.EXCERPT FROM THE BOOKIn Santa Monica-Los Angeles, they say that now there are as many aspiring yoga teachers as there are aspiring actors. I'm not sure how accurate that statement is, but in recent years, there's certainly been an influx of new yoga teachers not just in Southern California, but globally. This makes it a pretty competitive marketplace, and the question then is, how can you make yourself stand out?The yoga career path is a unique one, different from becoming a teacher at a school or a trainer at a gym. Unlike those career paths, there are fewer definitive credentials and mandatory guidelines for becoming a yoga teacher. It's more like being a professional artist. Sure, you need basic technical training, but what will separate you from others is your personal interpretation, perspective, expression, and communication. The technical information must be balanced by your inspired and impassioned creativity and authentic voice. I think that's what will separate the yoga teacher who just teaches classes from the yoga teacher who creates an abundant yoga career.The first official step to turning your yoga practice into your professional career is to attend a Teacher Training, which is where you will receive a Teacher Training Certificate. But before your first Teacher Training (and you'll more than likely do several throughout your yogi-lifetime), I think it's pretty important to have a good grasp on your practice. What that means to you will be very personal, but I can tell you that my teacher Ally taught me that it doesn't mean you have to be able to stick your ankle behind your head, balance on one hand, or levitate. This was something I had a hard time wrapping my head around at first. I think it was a combination of self-doubt, setting impossible expectations, and fear. Like what you're reading?

Yet the vast investments organizations make in traditional training, including classroom and online training, often results in little or no real impact. Why is this? The answer is actually well known: Typical training is frequently based on simple memorization in an environment almost always separated from an individual’s actual workplace.However, a new model for professional development is emerging, referred to as ‘embedded training delivery’, which leverages direct participant interaction within a participant’s own working environment for the delivery of training. This new delivery model helps significantly increase the effectiveness of the participant, his or her own organization's staff, and by extension, all the internal and external stakeholders or customers that organization supports.This short program summary is designed to help the reader understand the dimensions of this new model and approach for professional development, its benefits to the individuals and organization, and provide some examples of its implementation. By embracing a new approach, organizations will realize a significantly greater impact from investments in professional development and finally realize the acceleration of success training was always meant to provide."

The story features a coal mine and a group of never say quit miners who wouldn't give up the ghost until the spirit rose up into the sky.  The essence of this history was lifted from conversations with my husband over meals at our kitchen table, with him telling me about events of his just finished shift at Energy Fuels Coal, in Florence, Colorado. Our home is in Rockvale, 5 miles from Florence, population 400 (possibly including goats, donkeys, rattle snakes and scorpions, along with some true human characters). In our cottage there, the surfaces don't always sparkle as brightly I'd like them to, but the living is deep, and it's home. The house especially feels so when I'm listening to Tom's work stories as he's eating supper or breakfast, depending on what shift he's worked. Maybe it feels even more so when he's out on our back 5 acres, toying with heavy old iron, rearranging it, or staring at sunlight slants on rust spots. And, it feels so when we drift into dreams at night, in a quiet town on the prairies, at the base of the foothills of the Wet Mountain Range of the Rockies.*VISCERAL HISTORY is the term I use for true stories told from the gut, usually featuring the perspective of the author in addition to one or a small number of individuals. I'm developing a code for this type of true account shared in a small collection of short works, mostly relating to the coal mining industry.This is a prime story in that collection which features my husband and his mechanic cohorts, updated 2015. From my point of view, these are male human beings at their best.With Respect,Linda Shelnutt andKINDLE GLOW BOOKS"

665,B00CMX53FU,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CMX53FU,Leadership Diaries,5.99,"How do we come to terms with the lack of leaders in a world where everyone discusses, preaches and encourages leadership? Something is wrong. That is the background of LEADERSHIP DIARIES.Whether organizing a birthday party, raising money for flood victims, inviting friends to a party or a soccer game on a Saturday morning, all of these activities require someone to play the leadership role. It seems like some people were born ready to lead while others were not. But everyone has the potential to lead. The question is how to unlock this potential.  That is the subject of the new e-book, LEADERSHIP DIARIES, from Brazilian cartoonist, writer and former global executive Luciano Pires, which explains the hypocrisy of today’s world in a cheerful, humorous and provocative manner. This book will help young people who are beginning their careers, as well as more experienced professionals, to understand how the professional universe works, based on the real experiences of an executive who led teams of professionals in a multinational corporation. And what's more: the book presents the point of view of a Brazilian, with a cultural background that is different from those of Europeans, Asians or North Americans.The author says: ""I wrote an introduction discussing the concept of leadership followed by a series of articles I have written over the past three years that describe real situations that somehow involved leadership. From each article I extracted a conclusion that is never “final.” In fact, I give the reader some insights I call “brain bait”, which he must reflect on. I would say that my book stirs things up and each person will deal with what they discover in their own way. I made a point to begin the book with a phrase by Kahlil Gibran: “The obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply.”I wrote about the obvious in a way that many people may have never seen before. I based my book, like the rest of my work, on the importance of judgment and decision making processes for a simple reason: at the root of all our problems, hits and misses, failures and successes, is our ability to judge and make decisions. There is no use for a state of the art computer, equipped with the most advanced software, operated by the most well trained professional who has mediocre judgment and decision making skills. Trained personnel can do the right thing, at the right time, the right way, but I’m concerned with doing the necessary thing, at the necessary time, the necessary way. 'Choosing what is necessary' is much more difficult than 'choosing what is right'. It involves technical, social, political, cultural and even aesthetic aspects that go far beyond the training companies provide to their employees. To train people in the technical aspects of these processes is to develop only one part of their judgment and decision making skills. LEADERSHIP DIARIES is about this 'something more'."""

The Government has taken your Social Security contributions and used the money to finance tax cuts for the rich, wars, and other government programs.  The money was replaced with worthless Government IOUs that are stored in a file cabinet at the Bureau of the Debt office in Parkersburg, WVContrary to the claims of many, The IOUs are not the same as the marketable U.S. Treasury bonds, held by China and other American creditors, which are real bonds that can quickly be turned into cash.

Joseph Templin lays out over ten critical tax plays, each with the potential to save at least $100 but usually more. This book gets you better prepared to ask the right questions and bring the right information to your tax preparer to maximize your refunds. This book hits the legal items that even your tax advisor usually misses.This book is an (almost) just-in-time work to help the average American save some money on their taxes at a point where every dollar counts. This is not some high fallutin' theory or cutting-edge conceptual device. These are simple, easily applied things that are OK'd by the guys in Washington that will reduce your tax bill. In writing these, our team followed six basic guidelines: 1. This must apply to the average American. We focused on people with incomes between $40k and $100k, so it could be used by a major chunk of us.2. It has a simple focus. If you need to have an advanced degree in nuclear engineering or finance to understand one of our ideas, it was junked because it does not help the average Joe if you don't know what you are doing and why. 3. It has to be easy to read. Generally, over three syllables is avoided and any math is limited to grade school level.4. Ideas are presented in small chunks. There is an old question, “How do you eat an elephant?” The answer is “one bite at a time.” Same thing applies here – little nibbles by you will help to reduce the tax bite. 5. These must be easy to do. If you have to jump through more than two hoops, it's too complex. 6. Every idea must be profitable. We used the idea of $100 minimum tax savings per idea as our first benchmark, but in your case, the savings could be more or less than that.  Bottom line is: you will be better off. So grab your seat and some notepaper. It could be worth a lot to you! For more information, visit http://www.toptaxsavings.com"
677,B00ILIU9S6,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ILIU9S6,The Social Golf Course: Increasing Rounds with Social Media,9.99,"Social media is not just a marketing and sales tool. It creates word-of-mouth excitement. It can help build business. It can attract more golfers. Market your golf course more effectively in the 21st century with social media using tools like Facebook, Twitter, email marketing, blogs, Instagram, YouTube, Vine, LinkedIn, Greenskeeper.org, Google+ and much, much more. SPECIAL BONUS:  Sign up for the 19th Hole Media Newsletter to continue to receive our industry leading thoughts and ideas on social media and how you can use it to get more golfers to your golf course. The Social Golf Course: Increasing Rounds with Social Media, written by Zeb Welborn of 19th Hole Media and John Hakim from Greenskeeper.org is an introduction to golf course marketing with social media.  EXCERPT FROM THE INTRODUCTION:""Social media is changing our economy ... forever.   Offline and online worlds have collided.  They will forever be intertwined.  To stay competitive, golf courses must build authentic relationships that translate into business. These relationships must help trigger the most effective form of advertising -- word of mouth -- taking place on social platforms in exponentially growing numbers.   We’ve talked with golf course owners, general managers and directors of golf across the United States. QUESTIONS:The sentiment is usually the same:  “I don’t understand social media,” one general manager said. “Social media is a fun thing to do, but it doesn’t benefit our golf course in a substantial way,” said a director of golf.“We’re doing social media, but it’s not working,” a golf course marketing director said.If you find yourself with similar doubts, concerns or worries, you should read this book: social media works. TESTIMONIALS:Here’s what the Director of Golf at Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club -- 19th Hole Media’s client for six months -- said:  “We wanted to thank our customers on our Facebook page, by offering discounted rounds, but we can’t because we’re booked solid until 4pm.”  The General Manager at San Dimas Canyon Golf Course -- 19th Hole Media’s client for eight months -- said:  “We’ve had the best month we’ve ever had at this time of the year, and in comparison with other golf courses similar to ours . . . we’re doing extremely well.”And as Tom Robinson, a golfer at Los Serranos Country Club, said: “Its been a year since adding Los Serranos to my ""likes"" list (on Facebook) and in that time I've played five rounds (never as a single) at the country club. Traditionally I will play maybe two total rounds per year at the course because of where I live.”Many golf course owners and operators are failing to see the potential of social media.  And the potential is massive.We can’t ignore change and change is upon us all. People are consuming information at an unprecedented rate.  And the best way to be heard in the noise of information bombarding golfers is to reach them relevantly: as they are deciding when and where to play.And that is happening on social media -- effective social media.  Social media can help your golf course communicate with golfers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Imagine having thousands of golfers talking about your golf course daily when they aren’t even at your course.   And the best part is the value you create -- is yours.  You get the benefit, not golf magazines or tee time wholesalers. By using social media effectively, you are communicating directly to the golfer and future customer rather than through a third party, achieving brand loyalty.So, the culture of a golf course should change to incorporate the social media online world into the traditional offline world to create the 21st century golf course -- The Social Golf Course."

Finance journalist Niall Brady takes us behind the scenes for the first in-depth account of a disaster that has cost investors millions. He shows how clients' funds were mis-allocated to cover losses, how the Financial Regulator, though aware of irregularities at CHC for years, failed to forestall the crisis, and how it remains unclear, over a year after the scandal was uncovered, whether people will get their money back. His account of the strange culture and practices of CHC makes House of Cards a must-read for fans of Too Big to Fail and The Big Short.Niall Brady is a chartered accountant and a journalist with the Sunday Times.'Damning ...

683,B00IJZYWKM,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJZYWKM,Recognize THEM!: 52 Ways to Recognize Your Employees In Ways They Value,3.99,"Employee recognition is a $40 billion industry. And as it has grown, employee engagement levels have remain unchanged and uninspiring. 70% of employees in the US remain disengaged, intellectually and emotionally, with their work and their results. These are 52 ways you can recognize your employees in ways your employees will value. How can I say that with such confidence? I have used each of these 52 ways in building a company strong enough to thrive in the face of two wars, a recession while competing against global brands whose advertising budgets dwarfed our company's total revenues. Yet, by recognizing the strengths and talents of our employees in ways in which they valued we became an indomitable force for our customers and ourselves.  Recognition by peers and by one's immediate bosses is one of the top ways to instill engagement and passion for their work among your employees. What's often overlooked by the well-meaning leaders in the employee recognition industry is the power of the simple steps to recognize another person. Saying hi, listening, recognizing their accomplishments to their peers and managers, celebrating those successes on social media, giving them the best parking spaces, organizing meetings so they are productive and meaningful. These are some of the simple steps that require not budget approval, no boring powerpoint presentations before a board or fellow managers. I used them and they drove revenue growth, positive cash flows, streams of positive testimonials and referrals, raised our customer loyalty scores and created an engaged and passionate culture of engaged workers where the primary expressions each day were smiles and congratulations. Employee recognition starts with recognizing that person who stands in front of you, who works with you each day, whose success contributes to yours, who spends the majority of their waking hours working with you and others to build a brand for which they can be proud. Employee recognition, in these simple steps, acknowledges our primary drivers as people and employees. Those drivers are overwhelmingly intrinsic not extrinsic. These include the ability to be recognized among their peers and by their immediate managers, the chance to grow, the tools and resources to accomplish their work, the authority and autonomy to work as an adult, the chance to fail and learn from that failure. Extrinsic motivations, salary and bonuses, are important. But ranking them among all motivators leaves them near the bottom of the list. The reason I shared this list along with inspiring quotes and the story of a successful leader who realized he could be even more successful if he invested a few moments each day in recognizing those around him is I understand the challenge of business leaders in building and sustaining their business. I understand the barrage of distractions demanding their time and the easy lure of pretty colors and the shiniest, newest, management buzzwords. Employee recognition is one of those trendy buzzwords. But it's execution is timeless. These steps can be used with any sized company in any country in any industry. You can take many of these steps as soon as you read them.  You can see the results and learn as you go, customizing them for your culture's needs. They are steps too often overlooked as more demands are placed on our time. Many of these steps are ones which I realized I had forgotten, thrown aside, in my urgency to reach the next quarter's goals. Once I reintroduced them, took them, saw their immediate impact, read the reports that showed their bottomline impact, saw the numbers of smiles and laughs grow along with our revenues and cash-flows, then I realized we had a strategy and package of tactics that would carry us through all the changes in our industry facing us. They did. Enjoy them. Take them. Enjoy their results. Let's create engaging workplaces that allow us to bring smiles back to our day."

Peltier has worked in entertainment for more than 20 years, making the darkly funny Reality Boulevard a true insider’s view of Hollywood and some of America’s biggest shows. In it, we see Oscar-winning producer Marty Maltzman and his staff out of a job – and out on the streets – when long-running docu-series Lights and Sirens is unexpectedly axed. But the Hollywood the team now faces is full of Kardashiansand Real Housewives, and they need to survive in a world where it’s very hard to tell what’s true and what isn’t – both on and off screen. Oscar and Emmy winning documentarian and veteran reality producer (Big Brother, Rescue 911) Arnold Shapiro called the novel “the best satirical look behind the scenes of reality television ever written”, adding: “It contains more truth than you would believe.” Todd Milliner, producer of Grimm and Hot in Cleveland, said: “During her 20-plus years in the business, Melissa Jo Peltier had a front-row seat, watching it all unfold. In this novel, she puts her dry wit and storytelling ability to good use, pulling back the curtain to reveal what really goes on. Entertainment writer Reel Life with Jane says: ” Her characterizations and descriptions, in particular, are original and visceral, and the book is simply a fun and engaging read.” Kirkus Reviews declares Reality Boulevard ""a zinging satire."""

Have you spent a fortune on facebook ads that don't work?  Or if you are just getting your business off the ground and want to attract the right customers from the start, this book is for you.  Attract customers Now From Facebook is for Enlightened Entrepreneurs looking to attract conscious customers now. Discover how to attract Likes, leads, and customers for your business so that you have more time, money, and freedom in your life. I’m Bret Gregory and I’m passionate about health and wellness and teaching enlightened entrepreneurs how to thrive and grow their business using Facebook.This wasn’t always my life. 8 years ago, I was running a successful financial advisory business that I grew from scratch. I had been in this business for 10 years and while it was financially successful, I was not truly happy, actually I was bored and unfulfilled. I was making money, but I wasn’t making a difference in people’s lives and in the world.This was when a family tragedy altered my life forever. In 2006 my 32 year old brother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and given nine months to live. His passing nine months later was the catalyst for a major shift in my life. I realized I was wasting my time working in a field that was not my true calling. I decided to dedicate my life to serving others and helping people achieve better health and wellness, so that anyone who wanted to avoid what my family had to go through would be able to.I cast off my suit and tie and sold my business. I then took the proceeds of the sale and bought a beautiful property in Costa Rica, and began developing a wellness community that would help people change their habits and live the healthy, natural lifestyles we are meant to.Not long after this, the global financial crisis of 2008 hit. I couldn’t get any customers purchased into our wellness community. I tried everything…and I mean everything …to get customers, and nothing was working. I did traditional advertising, Google ad words, I even hired a team out of India to do SEO.I knew if I couldn’t get customers, I was going to go out of business, so I set out on a mission to succeed and save our new business. I focused on using Facebook to get customers. After a lot of trial and error, and some financial investment I finally figured it out!I quickly grew a page to 200,000 fans, drove traffic to our website and got 2,400 email address opt-ins. From those opt-ins, 20 people flew down to Costa Rica and the subsequent sales totaled $1.5 million dollars and saved the business!Successful Facebook marketing meant we didn’t have to give our wellness community back to the bank.Now, I teach you, the enlightened entrepreneur how to thrive and grow your business on Facebook. I’d like to show you how to do things effectively the first time around so that you can use Facebook to attract new customers to your business now."

And in this quick interview with Big Al Schreiter, you’re going to hear exactly how to do that. Listen to the following two marketing claims and you’ll see how powerful this technique can be: “You should take antioxidants because they are essential for fighting cancer and staying healthy” or “There are two kinds of people in this world: those who take antioxidants now and those who take chemotherapy later.” Although both messages say basically the same thing, the first one appeals to your “logical” conscious brain while the other speaks to your subconscious. Learn the skill of appealing to that master, decision-making part of the brain and you’ll never have to worry about prospecting again. You’ll Also Hear… • Tips for breaking through the clutter and speaking directly to the subconscious mind • Examples of what your first words to prospects should be • Simple - sometimes even illogical -- ways to build rapport and establish connections right off the bat • Exploding the myth that you’ll be able to talk prospects into becoming customers after the first 30 secondsBecause the subconscious mind makes instant and immediate decisions, you only have a few seconds to make a good impression. So, obviously, those seconds need to count. And in this audio, you’ll hear how to start making them work."

Now a newly discovered connection between them has come to light—the “Red Tails” flew fighter cover for the mission. The remarkable story is revealed here by the author whose work James Bradley calls “amazing [and] riveting.”"
709,B005US3GRQ,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005US3GRQ,Quicklet on Thomas Friedman's The World Is Flat (CliffNotes-like Book Summary),,"ABOUT THE BOOK""The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century"" is Thomas Friedman's account of globalization: how it happened, what it means, and what we should be aware of when discussing the subject. Friedman’s inspiration for the book came about as he was traveling to India on assignment for the Discovery Channel. The topic of the documentary was outsourcing. It came as something of a shock to Friedman to find out how many tasks actually could be outsourced, from tax preparation to reading X-rays. More shocking was the realization that globalization wasn’t just about jobs. It is about culture, hopes, dreams, imaginations, and the future.If that seems like the rhetoric of romance, so be it. Because that is the way Friedman sees it, and that’s the way he wrote it. For Friedman, the confluence of political, social and technological events in the last few decades has been nothing short of astounding. After Bangalore, he is looking at the world through new eyes.""The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century"" was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 2005. The “Updated and Expanded” edition, reviewed here, was published in 2006.MEET THE AUTHORScott Charles has over a decade’s worth of experience as a research analyst. Scott spent 11 years at a Fortune 500 company providing research and analytical services to marketing teams, product managers, R&D staff, and executives. His specialty is doing comprehensive deep dives to support ideation processes, identifying business opportunities, market analysis and business development.EXCERPT FROM THE BOOKThomas Friedman is a controversial author and journalist. Some people don’t like his style, some don’t like his politics. I’ve covered the topic elsewhere, but it’s necessary to note it here as well. The reason is that ""The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century"" is serious work. Millions, if not billions, of people are going to live, die, suffer or prosper based on what happens in the next few years. So it should be reviewed seriously, and carefully.The world map was redrawn after WWI, and it’s being redrawn again now, only this time it’s because the principles of open free-markets, supported by a profoundly far reaching communication infrastructure, is driving change. It’s not just work that is being exchanged. It is power. And it is happening fast. As the post-WWI restructuring of political boundaries shaped our world for 100 years, and is still doing so, the decisions we make in the next few years will have the same impact on the next 100 years.BOOK OUTLINE+About the Book+About the Author+Synopsis+Key Terms and Definitions+Chapter-By-Chapter Commentary & Summary+Additional Resources"
710,B00HU65DZO,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HU65DZO,The Communist Manifesto,1.99,"In 1847, while in Brussels, the German Communist League asked Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx to draft a pamphlet on the principles of communism. It was published in 1848 under the title Manifesto of the Communist Party, and in it, Marx and Engels discuss the basic communist theories on society, economics, class struggles and politics. The Communist Manifesto was published at a time when revolutions were spreading throughout Europe, and the work was met with a mixture of praise and criticism. While the authors were blamed as scapegoats by authorities in the wake of social unrest, others were persuaded by the Communist League’s principles. The Communist Manifesto remains one of the most influential works in history, and has profoundly impacted political landscapes across all continents.HarperTorch brings great works of non-fiction and the dramatic arts to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.

The over-eager, boisterous, and aggressive pitchman who salivates at the sight of a new prospect and blatantly stalks potential customers through a showroom and around a sales area, this is the image we have attached to the word “salesman” in our mental dictionaries.At one time, it might have seen an oxymoron to use the term “introverted salesperson,” but times have changed. More than ever before, employers are seeing that need for introvert sales people is on the rise. The days of the back-slapping, fast-talking salesperson are gone.Sales introverts are not flawed. They don’t need to be cured because nothing is wrong with them. Introversion is a collection of traits that we are born with. Their brain works in another way. It is about what goes on internally, not what is observed externally. This e-book will show you how to become an Introvert Sales Expert, how to cold call (there are few chapters about cold calling for introverts) and be more successful in selling."

734,B00JL3SXQU,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JL3SXQU,"Oracular Marketing: How to Build an Evergreen Online Marketing Platform for Your Business, Products and Services",2.99,"So what is Oracular Marketing?  Simply put it is an online marketing platform that: (a)Predicts what your avatar (or ideal client) is looking for, and;(b)Puts your business, product or service under your avatar’s nose no matter where he or she is looking for what they desire or need, and;(c)Sends them to a series of highly targeted, personalized messages that zero in on exactly how to fulfill that desire or solve that problem by taking an action that will result in an immediate purchase or lead to the purchase of whatever it is that you are selling.It is an automated system that saves the business owner and his staff time, and delivers highly targeted prospects to his place of business, cell phone or email.  The system is oracular in that it automatically will speak to exactly what the prospect is in need of and nothing more until the prospect is led to take action.  It could be called the fairy dust of internet marketing as it seems to magically generate leads and sales when correctly implemented.  Assuming of course it is set up for a business, product or service that people actually need.In essence marketing in an ""oracular"" way is the process of predicting what problems people will have and solving them before they know that they have a problem at all. It is accomplished by implementing two key moving parts. One part delivers content to all of the channels that people search for solutions to their problems; and the other part gathers the contact information from the folks who discover themselves in need of a solution for their problem, and then automatically gives them the opportunity to resolve that problem either by being led to the purchase of a product or service, or leading them to take an action like calling a business to make an appointment.The sales and closing strategies used in the book are evergreen. I didn't invent them I have simply been using them since the dark ages which ended in 1988 when the United States government opened up the internet to public use and CERN overlaid with the World Wide Web as public domain property. What has changed, and continues to change every day is the number of channels using the World Wide Web by which people find solutions to their problems."

738,B00KFODGAC,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KFODGAC,Oikonomics,5.99,"WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES OIKONOMICS MEAN?Oikos is an old word that means “household.” It referred to a specific network of relationships that functioned as an extended family with a specific purpose. It would have included biological relatives as well as friends, servants, and business associates. Everyone lived within an oikos in the ancient world.We are re-learning how to live like this, with Jesus in the center. This is how the ancient world was transformed—the good news of Jesus multiplying from oikos to oikos, along the lines of relationship as the gospel was shared in the everyday tasks of life.And of course “nomics” refers to economics, which has to do with how we invest, exchange, and grow the various kinds of capital that we possess. So Oikonomics is about the economy of our oikos, the way our household invests its time, energy, and money.As we seek to live as Families on Mission, the way we invest our time, energy, and money directly affects how effective and fruitful we become. It’s a big discipleship issue, and Oikonomics looks at how Jesus did this with his Family on Mission andhow we can imitate him in it."

Manual Jobs, the author, will walk you through the process of:Selecting your target audience to market toRecognizing what the pitfalls are that new business owners should avoidFinding financing if you need working capital for your new ventureSetting up the correct type of business (sole proprietorship, partnership,  limited liability or corporation)Setting achievable goals (long and short-term)Getting a website in place and much, much moreA Few Tips From The Kindle Book On Starting A Business1. Take Time To Write a Business PlanNever use the fact that you are just starting a small business as an excuse to skip on writing a formal business plan. You may not be proposing to anybody. You may not be facing a team of investors. You may not be looking forward to reaching out to angel investors. You may not even be thinking of applying for a bank loan. Still, you need a proper business plan.Review your business plan often. Make changes to it in accordance with what is and isn’t working in your business. If you find one or two things that are really profitable in your adventures, alter your plan to accommodate getting laser focused on these areas. In business, when you discover what is really working, you focus on ramping up those areas in order to make more money as fast as possible. Your business plan will help you see what is and isn’t profitable. 2. Survey More Than One Strategic LocationLocation is a very important thing when it comes to small businesses. There is the argument that you can always market or advertise in an attempt to draw customers to your location. Still, it pays to have your business placed in a strategic location where there are already potential customers. This is why it’s best to have a clothing store in a mall rather than out on it’s own. The mall already has people.3. Always Deliver on Your PromisesIf you promise to deliver something on Friday, try to deliver it on Thursday or earlier. Never delay.  Make sure that every product you make is as good as you promised it would be. One of my favorite sayings is, “under promise and over deliver”. If there are any problems, handle it professionally and keep in mind the age-old passage that says, “the customer is always right”. You must always remember that behind every apple seed is an entire orchard. You never know who your customer will be referring you to if you do a great job. One of the things my mother always told me is that I'd never get rich by working for someone else. That must be why I've started four small businesses over the past forty five years.There's nothing better than being in control of your own time and destiny. Owning a small business will allow you to have control over both of these.When you own a business, you don't have to do everything on your own. Always stick with what you do best and hire other people to do the things you don't know how to do.

Yet while other games such as soccer, rugby and cricket went on to become globalized sports enjoyed by millions of people and watched by billions, Gaelic games did not.

Part 1 is a personal account of the author's attempt to bring hurling to a broader audience in the United States.Part 2 is an examination of how today's globalized sports came to their dominant position after having been codified in England, and compares their fortunes to those of Gaelic games.Part 3 makes the case that the GAA needs to change its approach to the worldwide dispersal of Gaelic games in order to be more ambitious, and includes a series of radical proposals aimed at achieving a more globalized audience that is not limited to small communities of Irish emigrants or their descendants."

The panic came from working too hard on things I didn't enjoy, and not being able to spend more time doing the things I loved. From that day forward I decided to change my lifestyle. But, the catch, I couldn't just quit working, I had to continue to build a profitable business to make money for my family. Sound familiar?I did it. I actually began to build a better, stronger business and brand while working on the things I loved and was passionate about. Oh, and now I get to go fishing more often and coach my kid's sports teams and be a better person. A happy person.This is NOT a book about making money online by clicking a button.

This book helps you decide whether or not running a promotion on Groupon or similar site is an economically superior option or not. The methods are purely based on numbers and economics and not on my opinions or biases. Informed decision making based on numbers and data is hard but the alternative threatens the very viability of your business.Decision making gets harder when all the costs are not explicit and how the options are presented to us affect our decision making process. This book brings out the hidden costs that most do not always consider, like opportunity cost, and helps you cast aside anchors and framing influences that cloud your decision making.Consider this, if you plan to give away 2000 units of your product that is usually priced at $100 for a discounted price of $50, and give another $25 to the Group Coupon site, should you not take the time to understand the final and lasting outcome of such a promotion and whether or not it is better than all other options?For a price that is less than the cost of an average group coupon promotion, or less than one half of one percent of your total promotion spend, this book will not only help you avoid costly promotion mistakes but also will help you understand how and when to successfully employ it to take advantage of it.This book is not a course in business management, economics, marketing or on how to run your business. But the principles shown here are rooted in business management and are no different from the business methods used by large corporations when they decide on marketing and product investments."

In that capacity, he sold a screenplay and got to write on several television shows, including Spaceballs: The Animated Series, produced by legendary filmmaker, Mel Brooks.In 2007, while working as a hack-web-writer by day and screenwriter by night, Adam had a powerful epiphany, sparked by science writer Gary Taubes' book Good Calories, Bad Calories. This book convinced Adam not only to stop eating carbohydrates but also to take to the internet to use his web writing skills to advocate for a radical, alternative theory about obesity called lipophilia.Adam is convinced that lipophilia holds the key to ending the obesity epidemic. His blog and podcast, Caloriegate, chronicle the implications of lipophilia and other strange but cool counterintuitive ideas.The one theme that binds this motley body of work together is Adam's passion for looking at old problems from new perspectives. As Albert Einstein once said, ""the mere formulation of a problem is far more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skills. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science."""

So begins the MBA Oath, conceived in early 2009 by Max Anderson, Peter Escher, and a team of Harvard Business School students. They saw that in the wake of the financial crisis, the Madoff scandal, and other headlines, MBAs were being vilified. People were angry because business leaders, many of whom were MBAs, seemed not to care about anything beyond their own private interests. Many began to question the worth of business schools and the MBA degree.  The oath quickly spread beyond Harvard, becoming a worldwide movement for a new generation of leaders who care about society as well as the bottom line. Thousands of graduating MBAs have now pledged to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity, just as medical students swear by the Hippocratic oath before they can practice.  This book is the manifesto for the movement. It provides not only a strong case for why the MBA Oath is necessary but also examples of how it can be applied in the real world.

He was an introvert who knew how to utilize the strengths of the introvert - original thinking, depth, focus and attention, ability to listen to the messages from his soul, etc. - in the expression of his craft. But Van Gogh died depressed and penniless, having sold only one of his 900 paintings. He didn’t even get cash for that one lone painting. He merely gave the painting to the bar owner as payment for his tab.Had Van Gogh been more assertive and gregarious, there is no doubt that he would have sold much more and gained respect while still alive. Yes, Van Gogh was a great and historic figure in his field but he never got to experience any of that success while he was still living, unlike, Picasso and Warhol decades later, two introverts that had the behavioral flexibility to become gregarious, assertive and outgoing on cue. These two lived rich because they knew “how to party” in addition to merely knowing how to introspect.If you are an introvert, by all means be happy for your strengths and leverage them to the max. But also realize that the best tasting lemonade sold in the middle of a dessert will never get the chance to be appreciated by anyone nor will it make its creator any money. In this short (takes less than 10 minutes to read) but potentially life changing e-pamphlet you will discover the 3 key beliefs that will automatically build inside of you the attitude that will make becoming an extrovert natural for you while at the same time allowing you to maintain – and even strengthen! – your introvert strengths.

Therefore, “Excel VBA – In Everyday Language” was written in order to provide a response to the growing demand for the advanced capabilities of Microsoft Excel.This book was written:•For the “non-programmers” among us who have to create the same reports in Microsoft Excel time and again, and would like to automate the process.•For people who wish to develop forms, screens and “machines” for data management within their organization.•For individuals who wish to turn Microsoft Excel into a powerful tool in their daily work.For Non-ProgrammersDuring the writing process I tried to visualize Microsoft Excel software and the VB editor through the eyes of the end users; people who may not have programming background, but aspire to reap the utmost from the program.For this reason the book, based on many years' of experience in programming and training, has been written in everyday language, using as few technical terms as possible, to make for easy reading.My goal, when writing this book, was to convey the main principles of VBA language and allow beginners, taking their first steps, to learn without requiring individual training.For this purpose there are files of exercises accompanying the book.

Therefore, wherever there is a significant difference between Excel 2010/2013 and the old versions, explanations are provided in full.While reading the book and using the practice files, you will know to:•Add the Developer Tap•Change Excel's security, Including trusted locations•Enter the VBE (Visual Basic Editor)•Change the VBE structure•Record an absolute macro•Record a relative macro•Improve your recorded macro•Apply to ranges (Cells, ranges, columns, rows, sheets, offset)•Use Variables•Use the 'With' command•Manipulate strings•Calculate Date and Time•Interact with the user (Msgbox and Inputbox)•Use conditions (IF)•Loop through data (Do loops, For loops)•Create your own functions (UDF)•Create an Event macro•Handle ErrorsYou will also learn some cool tips and tricks, and get some useful codesThe book includes excercises. you can download the files from: bit.ly/Excel-VBA"

850,B00FWWXSAA,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FWWXSAA,The Hard Work Lie,5.99,"You have been taught your whole life that hard work is the key to success—that you can achieve anything as long as you work hard. But what if it is a lie—what if hard work is not the key to success that you’ve been taught it is? What if hard work is sabotaging the very success you are seeking? Millions of people work hard every day, but only a very small percentage of these people are what one would consider successful. If hard work is indeed the key to success, why is this so? Why is it that most of the wealth and power in this world is concentrated in the hands of a few? Certainly, these individuals do not have the monopoly on hard work. And if hard work is not the key to success, what would motivate people to propagate this falsehood?  “The Hard Work Lie” examines these questions and seeks to expose what the author believes is the long-held myth that hard work is the ultimate key to success—the myth that keeps people running in the hard work hamster wheel even though they are going nowhere. The final chapters of the book also reveal truths—as opposed to mistruths—that the author has found to be fundamental to the achievement of success."

870,B008KODLJ0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008KODLJ0,All About PDF Stamps in Acrobat® & Paperless Workflows,19.95,"Going Paperless? Already using PDF and need more? Need a better way to do things? PDF stamps are not just helpful; they are a necessary component of almost any paperless document process. This book reveals all the techniques and secrets for creating and using custom PDF stamps in Acrobat so you can use less paper, produce better-looking documents, reduce data entry errors, and increase efficiency for many basic business processes.A PDF stamp is a bit like an old style rubber stamp, in that it is one of the primary ways to add extra (custom) information to a document as it moves through a process (i.e., a document workflow). Like a rubber stamp, a PDF stamp is a custom graphic, but a PDF stamp is much more than a rubber ink stamp could ever be. A PDF stamp is like an old-style rubber ink stamp on super steroids. Not regular steroids, but super steroids. Because, a PDF is an electronic document, so a PDF stamp is about as close to a rubber ink stamp as the map Columbus used to cross the Atlantic is to a GPS. Your rubber ink stamp doesn’t automatically acquire data from the document and then send it to a database. A PDF stamp assisted workflow can do that because a PDF stamp can contain active code that dynamically modifies the stamp graphic, accesses the document being stamped, and communicates with other scripts. Of course, a PDF stamp can also be just like a rubber ink stamp if it needs to be. Hence, anytime there is a need to “stamp” something onto a PDF document, it is the PDF stamp that comes to the rescue.Stamps have been a part of Acrobat and PDF for a long time. As you might imagine, they are a popular feature of PDF, so stamp creation and workflows have developed into their own specialties. To explain what they are and how they are used the book is divided into three parts, where each part delves progressively deeper into the details of PDF stamps and how they are used in paperless workflows in the Acrobat environment.Part I provides a general “how and why” discussion on PDF stamps. The first chapter explains everything there is to know about PDF stamps qualitatively. It is an outline of all the material in the book. Chapter 2 explains the role of PDF stamps within a paperless workflow and presents several examples (in a variety of industries) where PDF stamps solve real world document processing issues. Part I is not just an introduction to stamps. It also provides important information to managers and others who will be developing and/or overseeing document processes.Part II eases into the technical details of PDF stamps. It begins with material appropriate for the novice and non-technical user, such as the menus and tools in Acrobat for working with stamps. It then progresses into increasingly advanced topics: creating custom stamps, the internal details of the stamp file, and protecting stamps from unauthorized usage. This part of the book is for anyone who needs to know how you actually use and manage custom stamps. It includes some expert tidbits and JavaScript examples for more advanced readers, but you do not need to know anything about programming to understand the topics.Part III is for programmers. It covers the two areas of the Acrobat scripting model that involve stamps: dynamic stamp scripts and workflow automation. The ability to alter the stamp appearance dynamically and use stamps within an Acrobat automation script provides two very powerful tools for processing documents. Nevertheless, even non-programmers will find a great deal of valuable and usable information in this portion of the book. While Part III contains some deep and complex material, all the concepts are accessible to the novice, and there are scripting examples that anyone can use."

877,B00C0YZKHC,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C0YZKHC,Keystone XL: Down the Line (Kindle Single) (TED Books Book 34),2.99,"The proposed Keystone XL pipeline has enflamed the bitter fight over America's energy future. Opponents of the 1,700-mile pipeline, which is designed to bring oil extracted from Canadian tar sands down to the US, say it represents a furthering of a dead-end oil-based energy policy that is unsustainable and poisonous, and have turned the permit requests to build the pipeline into an environmental litmus test for President Barack Obama. Supporters of the Keystone XL say it represents a step toward America's energy independence. Beyond the Beltway, the real story of this pipeline is one about American frontiers - the lengths to which we go for oil and the intrusive effects that quest causes all the way down the line. Steve Mufson, a reporter for The Washington Post, journeyed by car along the length of the proposed pipeline to see what this policy debate looks like at the ground level. Each segment of his trip touched on different issues: climate change and the oil sands; the U.S. energy trade with Canada; the North Dakota shale boom and its woes; prairie populism in Nebraska and pipeline politics; the Ogallala aquifer and the threat of leaks; Native Americans and their desire to protect land, water and burial sites along the old Trail of Tears; the fight of ranchers and farmers against a Canadian company’s right to eminent domain; and why both oil sands producers and Texas refiners want to see the pipeline completed. As long as the world relies on fossil fuels for transportation and industry, we will face unappealing choices. The Keystone XL pipeline serves as a larger metaphor, illuminating the vast energy infrastructure it takes to sustain the American lifestyle and the debatable choices we must make in pursuit of short-term comfort. Which risks, now and in the future, are we willing to take?"

Others get started on their ideas full of enthusiasm and excitement only to get side tracked with something new the next day. There is lots of work in progress and little to show for it. Neither one makes their clients happy and generates the income they are capable of.Bringing ideas to life is about being open to move things along and let them evolve into something great - or let them die. There really are no “right” ideas that we can know ahead of time. Those ideas are already taken. They are implemented. Somebody else did it. It’s in the nature of new ideas that there is no way of telling how “right” they are and how to best implement them. We need to figure things out as we go along.In the other extreme, a lot gets started and little gets completed. There is always something new and more exciting right here. They are the ones who exclaim: “Oh, look, something shiny!” In those situations, the ability to focus and be tenacious becomes critical to binging ideas to life. In either case, there is path that can help you move an idea along that leads to happy clients and more money in your bank account.This e-book describes the path from idea to implementation in 4 simple steps. Each step has their own challenges and potential pitfalls where people can get stuck and lose their momentum. Those are the points where people stop and take their attention to other places. In a simple framework, the authors describe how to recognize when we lose momentum and how to shift our attention to keep moving forward. You will be able to identify your personal style and which traps you have to be on the look out for so you don’t get stuck. They provide the tools to move out of being stuck. You will build and sustain your momentum, create better client relationships and improve your personal bottom line.The examples in the book make reference to marketing, blogging, and professional services. However, the basic framework of ideas is universal and easily translatable into any area of business and life."

A flight attendant needs to enjoy meeting and talking to people, while making them feel comfortable and happy to be on the flight. I’m naturally social and love getting to know others. Also, my experience in a travel agency has prepared me for the new challenge of working as a flight attendant because of its service nature. Being a flight attendant will expand my experience and fulfillment within my career.#2) One passenger is visibly nervous during the flight. What will you do to help him?If I notice that a passenger looks nervous, I will go to him first and find out what he needs. I’ll suggest some warm milk or tea to help him calm down. While I’m serving him, I’ll also ask a few questions about where he’s going and what he’s going to do there. After that, I’ll recommend that he take advantage of the in-flight entertainment or try to get some rest. Hopefully, he’ll be calmer by that point, but I’ll check on him once in a while to be sure.Practicing these answers written by an experienced, native speaker will help you build confidence and learn new expressions, which will give you a big advantage during your interview."

Online Job Search Guides Book 2)",0.99,"Most job seekers think that “the holidays” at the end of the year are not a good time for a job search, so they take a holiday from their job hunting. Big mistake! The year-end holidays can be the BEST time to job hunt, MUCH better than January, because employers are trying to be fully staffed before the New Year. During the holidays, fewer people are job hunting even though employers don't stop trying to fill their jobs, so holiday job seekers face less competition. With so many more people waiting until January to re-start their job hunting, the competition is much tougher AFTER the holidays!§  Only 3% more jobs were filled in January and February of 2013 (vs. November and December of 2012). AND it is very likely that MANY of those job offers made in January were based on interviews that happened in November and December.§  Only 1% more jobs were open in January and February of 2013 (vs. November and December of 2012).In this short – but packed – ebook, Richard N. Bolles (author of ""What Color Is Your Parachute?"") offers his special holiday job search tip in the book's Foreword. Then, 26 of the job search and career experts who write columns for jobs portal Job-Hunt.org have contributed their tips for helping job seekers successfully continue their job search during the year-end holidays, from Thanksgiving through New Year's Day in the USA. These are short nuggets of advice, easily digestible, and categorized by the kind of problem or issue job seekers face during the holidays, including:•Beat the Blahs •Handle Those Awkward Questions and Conversations •Pre-Party Prep and Planning•Painless In-Person and Social NetworkingSpecial tips for Veterans and college students are also provided.  While these tips will help you through the year-end holidays, many will also come in handy during the rest of the year during other holiday events, networking opportunities, and anyone's typical job search.In addition to Dick Bolles, the 26 experts contributing their tips to this book are (in alphabetical order): Jason Alba, Diane Hudson Burns, Dr. Jan Cannon, Laura DeCarlo, Dr. Kate Duttro, Parmelee Eastman, Megan Fitzgerald, Wendy Gelberg, Don Goodman, Meg Guiseppi, Stephen Hinton.

But most of these people have no idea on what it takes to raise bees, where to place the hive, where to obtain bees and how much the bee equipment costs.Grant Gillard, a beekeeper since 1981, shares his passion and enthusiasm as to why he keeps bees, and how he stays motivated despite receiving bee stings every time he works his bees.  He also shares the delight of harvesting and selling honey at several local farmer's markets.This manuscript helps you define your purpose as to WHY you want to keep honeybees, but also how you allow your purpose to fuel your vision of where you might want to go (or where you might want your bees to take you!).Grant shares some ""how to"" techniques on getting started, but also richly expresses his philosophical reasons for keeping honeybees.  A must read BEFORE you decide to enter into this fanscinating hobby of the honey bee."

This analysis of the replacement process, and its consequences, is by one of the b est-known market analysts in America – the founder of Harris Interactive. This is a must-read for everyone who is affected by this revolution, which appears to be the fastest growing technology replacement in history.Dr. Black argues that the current data on eReader sales indicate that we are witnessing the single fastest growing replacement technology in history -- from four million eReaders of all types at the end of 2009 to more than 120 million units by the end of 2012 in the United States alone. He predicts that fiction paper books will decline to less than half the market during the middle of next year, with profound disruption for the retail store segment of the market.The report also maps out likely new areas of opportunity for everyone (and investment) in the industry -- both new and established authors, agents, publishers and even retail.

Every day your choices determine who you are. You are what you decide.Life is a cascade of challenges. Sometimes the flow trickles and sometimes it roars. How well you navigate determines who you are and your quality of life. Do you embrace the flow or avoid it? Does a torrent motivate or immobilize you? Do you look to the future with hope or fear? Your answers to these questions probably correlate to your decision-making skill.From our first months as infants, we are hard-wired to want to choose. Why then do we often struggle with decision-making? Avoid it? Fear it? Why are we occasionally abysmal at it?The answer is simple. Most of us have never been taught formal decision-making processes. (Well, my mother always did tell me to make a list of the pros and the cons!) Without a set of decision tools and techniques to draw on, anyone can become overwhelmed by weighty decisions.Decision-making is not just about the fork in the stream, the moment of choice-making, the selection of the final option. Decision-making is a process that requires commitment, exploration, ideation, courage, self-reflection, evaluation, action and continuous learning. Further, decision-making involves more than critical thinking. Indeed, it is an inherently creative act.The Eight Keys will help to improve your deliberate decision-making:- Commit resources commensurate with the weight of the decision.- Know explicitly what you are trying to achieve.- Consider all possible options.- Conquer your fear to make a mistake, to fail or to take a risk.- Know and question all your key assumptions.- Be acutely aware of and root out cognitive biases and fallacies.- When making important choices, be deliberate: decide how you will decide.- Act decisively, monitor closely and learn continuously.With practice, the Eight Keys will enable you better to navigate life's cascade of challenges.The stakes are high. There is no avoiding life's still waters or its raging rapids. Every day, you make -- or avoid -- decisions.Every day your choices determine who you are.You are what you decide."

Its popularity ebbs and flows, but it has been remarkably long-lived for a scam of this type. The opportunity is pitched as a way to profit from a nearly worthless dinar (at least when compared to the U.S. dollar) that is “sure” to appreciate in the future.The scammers promise that millions of dollars in profits are virtually guaranteed if you buy the dinar at today’s exchange rate of 1 U.S. dollar (USD) per 1,166 Iraqi dinar (IQD) and then sell the dinar back for dollars at a later date once the USD/IQD exchange rate has improved.Sadly, the promised riches are never going to materialize.I decided to write this book to put everything I have written since 2008 about the scam – plus more – in one place. I have had lengthy debates with scammers, dealers, pumpers and victims, and to my knowledge, I have addressed all the major arguments made by the scammers for why the dinar is not a one-way ticket to riches. I have also made every attempt to make sure I am providing the primary source for everything I have said. You won’t find any quotes from a message board, conference call or any “secret intel” from an un-named government insider here.What you will learn in this book:1.The basics of the dinar scam 2.The pitfalls of investing in the dinar3.The truth behind the lies of the dealers, scammers and pumpers4.Why growing economies don’t want a growing currency5.The difference between revaluation (RV) and redenomination (RD)6.What happened with prior RVs and RDs?7.How dinar dealers make money from their victims8.How to get rid of your dinar"

986,B004Q9U19G,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q9U19G,An Engineer's Guide to Silicon Valley Startups,9.99,"I've worked at 5 different startups in my career in Silicon Valley. While every company is unique, there are many similarities between Silicon Valley startups. As workplaces go, Silicon Valley startups embody the American dream: they're exciting, fun, and provide employees with great flexibility and freedom. Join the right startup, and you can change the world! This book covers topics of interest to anyone who wants to work at startups:How do you get a job at a startup?How do you choose which startups to talk to?How do you approach interviewing at a startup?How would you negotiate compensation?Once at a startup, what should you do to maximize gains from stock options?Why is it advantageous to exercise your stock options in certain conditions?What do the clauses in your offer letter mean?How do the clauses in your stock options contract affect you?Drawing from my 17 years of experience at various pre-IPO companies in Silicon Valley, I provide answers to the above questions. Extensive examples, case studies, and detailed background are in the book.After learning about the personal finance side of handling stock options, I joined Google less than a year before the IPO and discovered that what I had learned was hardly common knowledge. Despite explaining the details to several colleagues, many chose not to do the financially advantageous thing, leading to an increased tax liability of several hundred thousand dollars. This book was the result of observing these failures, and trying to prevent others from making the same mistakes.What's different about this book?Emphasis on the engineering non-founder. Most startup books are focused on the founder(s). For every founder at a successful company, there are hundreds of non-founders. This book is for everyone who is not a founder. I don't tell you how to raise money or read a term-sheet. That's the founder's job. Frequently, the founder's goals and your goals are different. For instance, when negotiating compensation, the employee and employer sit on opposite sides of the table.Short and to the point. Pages are not wasted telling you how to write a resume. I show you how an engineering interviewer thinks. I did over 300 interviews for Google, and sat on a hiring committee for 3 years. Before that, I was an engineering manager for 3 different startups and also performed hundreds of interviews.Covers the important tax planning topics that very few startups will tell you because of fear of lawsuits. Employers are not allowed to push their stock onto their employees.Quotes and experience from well-known successful startup experts like Wayne Rosing (Google's first Senior VP of Engineering), Jeff Rothschild (VP of Technology at Facebook, Co-Founder of Veritas, Co-Founder of Mpath Interactive), and other startup veterans.More importantly, you'll get to learn what other engineers think!"

The product can also be a form of service. It may be in physical or cyber form. All types of commodities are produced with a cost and should therefore be sold for a certain price which is profitable to the seller.There are three fundamental products that I would like to mention.

The truth is selling digital merchandise is said to be very lucrative although it requires extensive time and financial resources to come up with something high quality.The second is affiliate. It is a neat strategy for beginners and with a little bit of luck and really good products, you can flourish in the long-term. Many online marketers have been successful in this web venture. The catch here is that you have to find the best affiliate product that promises to sell well. Scams also abound nowadays so make sure that you are not dealing with a dubious character.

What it Takes brings together the author’s experience in Australian industry with her understanding of the interpersonal skills required for success. Through case studies and practical exercises she explains the techniques of persuasion, influence and motivation relevant to the work environment. These techniques are directed towards increasing personal effectiveness, work satisfaction and potential for career advancement.

Think different.There are hundreds of writings mentioning Steve Jobs’ secrets, but there has been no major, final compendium . . . until now.For this work, we did not interview Steve Jobs for years, nor his immediate family, nor the dozens of employees, nor vendors, nor family members. There was no need. There is enough information out there! The problem is that it is not ordered, and it is propagated everywhere. Yet, not a single document compiles all the secrets of Steve Jobs. So what we did was simple: we collected all we could on the issue (videos, blogs, books, articles; and, above all, the biography launched in late 2011 by Walter Isaacson, because it is the most complete document available). We analyzed it and organized it. We revealed, we obsessed, and we dreamed with him all night long, and in the end, we were certain that we had found all of the secrets. In the end, we found that there are 66 things that Jobs did that made him great.Some Secrets you will learn reading this book:• Do you know how many people Steve hired, personally conducting the job interviews? 11 secrets will help you understand the keys of human resources.• Did you know you have to lose your inhibitions to be successful? 2 secrets will show you how to obtain fast decision-making from others, and we will share two incredible anecdotes from Jobs!• Humanity’s drive, for good or bad, has been wars: for liberty, territory, power . . . also for Jobs. 2 great secrets will show you how to use that drive in your favor. • It is super rare for someone to be extremely creative and disciplined at the same time, another key for Jobs. 4 secrets will help you achieve it.• The traditional way of controlling money limits success. 3 secrets will allow you to get rid of the financial mindset!... and much more!... (about strategy, marketing, advertising, leadership, entrepreneurship...)WHAT IS TIPIDIA?We are sick and tired of infoxication. There is enough information regarding how to manage all the issues that exist in the world, but propagated by thousands of websites and printed materials (blogs, websites, magazines, newspapers, books, videos, etc.). Why create more new content? So, one day, we decided to roll up our sleeves and take the first step, and this book is the first of many pieces of work on different subjects. But from now on, we want each piece of work to be written by dozens of people who are knowledgeable in the subject and who have come together to unveil the secrets of how to implement the chosen topics. At tipidia.com, we are creating the space to bring together all these people who want to share what they know and thereby develop a compilation of the secrets you need in order to accomplish a goal or perform a task in the best possible manner. Collective intelligence is the key. Visit tipidia.com and learn how you can help the world and make money.WHO WROTE THIS BOOK?At Tipidia we advocate collective intelligence, but we had to start somewhere. So the first step was to get together Tipidia’s collaborators and businessmen (from the marketing, advertising, innovation and finance fields), and we decided Tipidia’s first project would be unveiling all the secrets of Steve Jobs. Why? Because, as entrepreneurs, we are his fans! And because so much has been written about him that his keys to success have gradually become less understood.We know that we at Tipidia are not collective intelligence, but that does not matter. We had to start somewhere to be the spark that lights the fuse! If thousands of us get together, we can rearrange all of the information that exists in relation to the thousands of issues that exist in the world and generate, for each issue, a simple compendium of secrets that people need to manage better than anyone. At the moment, we are few, and that is why we need you. Join us. www.tipidia.com"

How To Write and Publish Your Own Fiction Profitably, Quickly and Easily...and Become a Bestselling Author Almost Overnight (How To Make Money With eBooks Book 1)",4.97,"Why Buy This Book?Because it will set you on the fast track to being a successful, self-published author, generating a high income from writing and publishing your own books. What This Book Covers:So you want to be a published fiction writer, huh? Well, the good news is that you can - because nowadays, no-one can stop you. Thanks to today's amazing technology and the self-publishing revolution that is accompanying it, there is no reason at all why you cannot publish your fiction - and make a full-time living from doing so. You don't have to be the next J.K.Rowling, and you don't need a degree in Creative Writing or Literature. If you can write good books in markets where people are buying books, then you are already halfway to becoming the next self-publishing success story (and the number of those is growing fast).The rise of the eBook has been fast and dramatic. Amazon is selling three ebooks for every print book - and they sell an awful lot of print books! James Pattereson has now racked up over five million ebooks sales, mostly in the last few months, and many authors are well passed the million sales mark. And while some of those are well-known writers, others are brand-new writers who had never published anything before ebook publishing gave them the opportunity to succeed. No More Rejections! If you have tried submitting a novel to traditional publishers, you will know just how frustrating the whole process can be. You write a book that you know is at least as good - if not better - than the ones you see on the bestsellers' shelf of your local bookstore. But all that happens is that your book disappears in the publishing mill for weeks, or even months, only to reappear eventually accompanied by a rejection slip. The problem is that traditional publishers have to take big risks to launch a book. Most publishers lose money on eight out of ten titles they publish. So they have to be very selective to have a shot at finding the one or two books that will be runaway successes and make enough money to keep the publisher out of the bankruptcy court. Thanks to the self-publishing revolution - and especially Amazon's Kindle publishing platform - all that has changed. Now you can publish your own book right now, with literally no expenditure. No more rejections, no more frustrations. No-one telling you that your book isn't right for the market, or that you might try sending it somewhere else. You can now be the publisher, make all the decisions, and make things happen. In fact, if you know what you are doing, it is entirely possible to launch a book today, and see it on the bestsellers' list tomorrow. This book will show you how. It's easier than you might think.

They do it in a clever way through actual dialog between prospect and salesperson. They identify the eight most common and deadly mistakes salespeople make that prevent them from uncovering the prospects compelling reason to buy.

Since then, we’ve had hundreds of thousands of readers reference our site, educating themselves on what to buy, how much to pay, where to safely store it, and many more PM questions folks like you come up with.This book, Storing Silver & Gold, is the second in a series based on our work at Theprospectorsite.com. The information in my previous book, Why Silver & Gold Will Go Higher, is only effective if we implement a strong plan for PM storage.Let me be perfectly clear, before we dive into your storage options: This book is not a sales pitch. I don’t sell silver or gold. I don’t provide storage for silver or gold either.

Yet, in After the Future, Tim Flannery shows that this country is now on the brink of a new wave of extinctions, which threatens to leave our national parks as “marsupial ghost towns.” Why are species becoming extinct despite the tens of millions of dollars being spent to protect nature? And what more should be done?In this passionate and illuminating essay, Flannery tells the story of the human impact on the continent. He revisits his Future Eaters hypothesis, discussing how firestick farming helped to shape the ecology and preserve native fauna. He looks at the way recent governments, in tandem with an indifferent populace and a rabid libertarian right, have let environmental knowledge and commitments erode.Finally, he describes new approaches to wildlife conservation and argues that Australia must take the lead on these. This is an essay that rings the alarm on behalf of the natural world, and asks us to think again about protection of its irreplaceable riches.‘Such is the depth of public ignorance about Australia’s extinction crisis that most people are unaware that it is occurring, while those who do know of it commonly believe that our national parks and reserves are safe places for threatened species. In fact the second extinction wave is now in full swing, and it’s emptying our national parks and wildlife reserves as ruthlessly as other landscapes.’ —Tim Flannery, After the Future‘Flannery is known as a passionate advocate for conservation, but rarely has he sounded so angry.’ —Fiona Capp, Sydney Morning Herald‘He's a scientist of world standing, a prolific and bestselling writer, a noted explorer, passionate about the Australian environment, and believes global warming is a calamitous crisis facing us all. Tim Flannery is also a controversial, outspoken stirrer who promises … to tread on toes if he has to, to get his blunt views across.’ —Kerry O'Brien, 7:30 ReportTim Flannery is the author of more than a dozen books, including The Future Eaters, Throwim Way Leg, The Weather Makers, Now or Never and Here on Earth. In 2007, he was the Australian of the Year. He is currently Chief Commissioner of Australia’s Climate Commission."

It covers all the tricks and traps of internet marketing including backlinking, creating authority, and launching black and greyhat campaigns.PREPARE TO SHOCK YOUR PROFITSSince 2005, I've seen thousands of SEO marketers lose entire income streams overnight. And it wasn't very long ago that I was in the same boat. I was executing online marketing just like everyone else, following what the gurus were saying, and sitting pretty on a few high ranking sites. I bought a hundred books on the subject, and sold a few of my own. As a result, I and a few of my associates became legendary in web marketing forii. But Then Everything ChangedOut of nowhere, my websites all TANKED. From pagerank 6 down to pagerank 4. Adsense income dropped by half.Naturally I later found out that it was thanks to a cute animal called the Google Panda. I found out that it had actually affected thousands of websites, and I wasn't the only one who got massacred.My Income Dropped by 60%As you might imagine, the cold sweats crept in and clouded my thinking. What was I supposed to do now? I had clients depending on my company's marketing promises. And now- I was failing them.Then it hit me.I wasn't building a sustainable marketing assault.So after getting killed in the SERPs, I finally learned my lesson. I decided to build a real, brandable business from that point on. No longer would all of my traffic come from SEO, but from multiple sources as well. That meant that even if Google slapped me silly, my sites and that of my clients continue getting traffic.And you know what happened? I developed a system of building websites that just cannot  fail.

1057,B00ATGA1X6,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ATGA1X6,The Lost Art of Project Status Reporting,1.49,"With the growing emphasis on project management skills across most industries, the need for effectively communicating a project’s status is just as important as the skills of executing the project itself. Sadly, however, most training courses and books fail to address this subject entirely or brush over it quickly.  It is often implied that pulling out the important details of your project should be easy and packaging it for your team, senior sponsors or clients will naturally occur. The reality is many status reports fail to convey the status and needs of a project. Status meetings often lack the focus needed to effective communicate the project’s status and direct future actions. The result of this ineffective communication contributes to the number of project failures. During project post mortems, we often uncover warning signs that were never presented or were buried in a sea of information. To the project team’s credit, they often knew of the problems, but their inability to communicate it through the status reporting process doomed them with every report. This book provides a simple and effective method to create and communicate project status. This is the method that I personally follow and introduce to people I mentor. When I first started managing projects I struggled to communicate project status correctly and often became frustrated at how status meetings were conducted. So I started researching the experts to see what they recommended. Some provided high-level or obvious tips and many appeared as if they never actually reported status before. I did learn one thing however. Reporting status correctly is not difficult provided you have the right framework. That is what you will learn here."

Your target should be to double your first presentation closing ratio.This book will:- show you how to set up your pitch in such a way that your customer will often ask what you think they should do, about buying your product, when you are finished presenting- cover how to discover their OBM (“Only Buying Motive”) and not their DBM (“Dominant Buying Motive”) which is the wrong concept even though most sales trainers say that finding the DBM is the key to closing- explain why there is always only one reason, not two or three, why people buy, and it’s usually a different reason than you might think- point out that, contrary to conventional wisdom, studying a customer’s needs is a mistake- demonstrate visualization techniques so your buyer will see themselves using your product and feeling like they own it even before you finish presenting- explain that, contrary to most sales training, there aren’t 15 steps to a sales presentation, there are only four, but those four must be understood, believed, and followed, in order, for your customer to make a buying decision while you are with them. If you skip a step, or get these steps out of order, you lose your customer and you lose the sale- explain how the sales process is much simpler and easier than most sales reps, sales trainers, and sales managers make it out to be; remember that they really need you to rely on them and buy more of their books, or attend more of their seminars and sales meetings- explain how and when to use mirroring and matching effectively- explain the role of fear in sales which is often the most powerful motivator to buy- explain the concept of price vs. value, and explain that making a sale is never about the money- explain why your customer needs to understand that you work on commission- explain many other powerful concepts to masterThis book also provides a number of specific examples of how to set up your presentation for the most effective implementation of the four-step plan.Study everything you can by as many “experts” as you have time for, and absorb what they have to say. Then, when you begin your presentation, forget it all and simplify the process down to its essence. Learn to communicate with your customer in a natural, easy way. This book will help you to do all of these things."

1074,B00523KEUQ,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00523KEUQ,The Yellow Pages Are Dead - Marketing Your Veterinary Practice in the Digital Age,9.95,"The Internet has burst into life. It’s been around for a while now, but it’s only in the past five years that things have really changed dramatically.What’s made the difference? Two things. Firstly, we’re way past a point where the web was just a geeky thing for spotty tech-heads. The Internet is everywhere and we’ve passed a critical mass of people using it. Significantly a growing number of people are using it on smart phones, which means that they are almost constantly connected to the web.Secondly (and this is the game-changer) social media has allowed all these Internet users to band together into huge online communities.In 1994 it was almost impossible to meet/communicate with someone else online, unless you had his or her email address. Now you just hop onto your favorite social-media site and hook up with one of the millions of other users out there.It’s this connectedness that businesses should be excited about – or terrified of. Never before has the consumer had so much power (remember the old adage about a customer who has a bad experience telling nine of their friends? Well, that’s changed for starters.) But on the reverse side, never before have businesses had such an amazing way to reach so many customers for so small a financial outlay.For once this is a trend and tool that is not beyond the reach of veterinary practices. In fact, such is the trust and interest in what we do, I can think of few other businesses which are in such a good position to take advantage of it.Many vet practices have already set up their Facebook accounts or twitter pages. Few, however, have joined the dots to really take advantage of the opportunity.This book will teach you what you need to do to harness the power of the web effectively to grow your business. And, as we’re currently in the midst of a global recession/depression, such knowledge can’t come quickly enough."

As Aneesh Chopra shows in Innovative State, once it became clear how much this would change America, a movement arose around the idea that these same technologies could reshape and improve government. But the idea languished, and while the private sector innovated, our government stalled, trapped in a model designed for the America of the 1930s and 1960s.The election of Barack Obama offered a new opportunity. In 2009, Aneesh Chopra was named the first Chief Technology Officer of the United States federal government. Previously the Secretary of Technology for Virginia and managing director for a health care think tank, Chopra was tasked with leading the administration’s initiatives for a more open, tech-savvy government.Inspired by private sector trailblazers, Chopra wrote the playbook for governmental open innovation. In Innovative State he offers an absorbing look at how open government can establish a new paradigm for the internet era and allow us to tackle our most challenging problems, from economic development to affordable health care."

More than other success books, we focus on a single stroke of genius to spring you forward.Skills management can prove daunting. The first step is separating skills for success from skills that the majority possess and use every day. These deserve your attention, energy, and commitment.Command is one of these skills and should be central to any success training. Command of mind, hands, workflow, and others’ attention dictates your ability to advance in the workplace and life. To lack command is asking to be taken less seriously in all that you do.The method in our success guide will help you to achieve and refine command sooner and more completely."

Relying on his market savvy and years of experience, Christopher identifies the steps necessary to bring a good idea to market. This information is crucial to new inventors, because the failure rate for the uninitiated is huge. To quote one of the largest invention advisers and inventor helpers’ websites:“From 2008-2010, we signed Submission Agreements with 4,756 clients. As a result of our services, 106 clients have received license agreements for their products, and 30 clients have received more money than they paid us for these services.”The average fee for those services was $21,500 per inventor. So that means that in three years only 30 people out of 4,756 made more than $21,500 with their inventions. But the invention advisers did well in spite of that, because their model, as is true of most “inventor helpers,” is to make money off the inventors and not the inventions. You don't have to fall victim to this type of ""help""!Get On The Shelf will teach you the following:Assessing whether you have what it takes to bring a product/invention to marketIdentifying whether you have a viable ideaProtecting your idea/inventionMaking a prototype for your idea/inventionGetting feedbackYour personal invention kit... and much more, all from a successful inventor who is willing to share his extensive knowledge and experience with you."

We see people all around us getting what they want, living happy and fulfilling lives, but don’t understand why it isn’t working for us. What can we do to change our results? Author Shawn Shewchuk knows exactly how that feels. He worked hard and made choices that he thought would lead to success, but while he was working hard, his relationships suffered and debt mounted until finally the house of cards came tumbling down. He went from being what he thought was financially secure, to bankrupt, divorced and homeless in a matter of months. While the experience was difficult, as he reassessed his life, it finally became clear that he’d been going about his attempts at success completely backward! As Shawn discovered the enigmas to real wealth creation and balance in his own life, his results soared and now yours can too. Change Your Mind, Change Your Results was created from Shawn’s own experience and he shares firsthand what works and what doesn’t. Most of us have no idea that many of the decisions we make in our lives are based on unsolicited gifts of ideas from our parents, educators and religious exposure. Although we may initially deny it, most the decisions that we make as adults, are not our own. This is the reason that we so often see children following in the steps of their parents, whether they want to or not. Now is your chance to step out of that cycle and create a different, more prosperous life for yourself and it all starts with a decision. Our minds are powerful tools, and they can create any reality we choose to envision for ourselves. Whether in your life, business, career or your relationships, you can achieve your objectives, and Shawn gives you the proven methodologies you need to make them a reality.

Originally a military text of stratagem, The Art of War has influenced military and political leaders throughout the centuries. His ideas still hold true today and are highly applicable to the modern-day battleground...corporations.Organizations have a collective psychology and oftentimes an underlying psychosis. Despite nearly 100 years of effort to make management a science, starting with Frederick Taylor in the early 1900s, organizations today are still composed of individuals and their feelings. Even though decisions that are made in everyday business are supposedly rooted in logic and rational thought, almost all decisions are ultimately judgments, and just like all of human behavior, those judgments are based on the individual's mood, feelings, and thoughts.This volume is to be consumed in small chunks, and highlights 21 of Sun Tzu's most applicable strategies. It is aimed toward helping the individual to become a master of his or her surroundings, situations, and adversaries in a corporate environment.This volume applies ancient philosophy to modern-day situations and highlights how we can influence the behavior of others by creating the environment we want, tapping into the feelings and thoughts of others, and ultimately impacting leadership judgments.Some may call it manipulation, some may call it deception.

The problem is most web designers don’t have a clue about what marketing is. It’s not about pretty websites or having a Facebook Page, it’s about engagement and persuasion.This book is the how, when, what and why of attracting new customers into your business, and keep them coming back for more. It’s about reaching your prospect BEFORE your competitor does. Unfortunately, many times, marketing “professionals” don’t help, and they can actually make things worse!The business growth and marketing industry has a vested interest in keeping you in the dark about what really works – they want to keep you coming back, month after month, year after year, and keep throwing money at their “ideas.”How about a proven system that works like gangbusters to increase your new customers, and keeps your clients coming back for more and referring friends to you!Inside this incredible book, you’ll discover the REAL secret to growing your business with minimal effort...for FREE!There’s so much marketing information out there that it can be overwhelming.

Overall, Foursquare usage, per Nielsen, was up 118 percent during the month year-over-year.What that means for the small business owner who’s struggling to get new customers is there's a wide-open opportunity to beat the competition using proven strategies to gain hordes of new customers.As you read this book, you’ll be amazed, awestruck, and inspired to find out how easily you can turn a struggling business into a hot spot of local customers who not only come back for more, but refer your business name to their friends and family.As an aside, I’m adding the free audio book and video tutorials on how to attract new customers, and keep them loyal, without spending thousands of marketing dollars on unnecessary marketing tactics that don’t work.Simply visit http://4SquareforBusiness.info for the latest updates."

If you have been working for any length of time on your Network Marketing business with little or no success, this book is your ticket to the good life. Don't let another day go by without reading this book. Get it! Read it! And then re-read it! After you have read it, recommend it to your team and everyone you know who is currently involved in the Direct Sales Or Network Marketing industries. Don't just read this first book in the ""Golden Rules Of Network Marketing"" series. Be forewarned, this book isn't like any other book on the subject of Network Marketing that you have ever read. You will be challenged, disturbed, invigorated and inspired by ""Make Lots Of Money In Multi-Level Marketing. Network Marketing, what is it and how does it really work? Well it doesn't matter if you call it Network Marketing, Multilevel Marketing, MLM or Direct Selling, Network Marketing is a business that has elected to distribute it's products through the recruiting of a distributor force in stead of using outlets like stores and promotional avenues like image advertising. Network Marketing companies will carve out a niche in a market that has lots of passionate people, industries like health and nutrition, skin care or even technology. When it comes to the question of whether Multilevel Marketing is a viable business or not, you will find many people on both sides of that argument. While you certainly should do your own due diligence before getting started in a Network Marketing company or any other venture, my life has been positively impacted by this controversial industry. Please understand that the purpose of this book is not to teach you step by step all of the intricacies of Network Marketing. It is intended to show you what is possible and get you started on the write path when you get started in your MLM career. Hopefully, it will inspire you, challenge you and help you to have the right dialogue when preparing to get started in the Network Marketing Industry. I have found that the Network Marketing Industry has been a great training ground for business in general and a way to earn while you learn the skills that are necessary to succeed in any venture. You may be reading this book because your are new to the industry of Network Marketing and you may be reading this book because you have been in Multilevel for a long time and still haven't found the success that is promoted at the opportunity meetings. What ever your reason is for reading Make Lots Of Money In MLM, I hope that you will find it helpful in the least and maybe even insightful enough to call it life-changing. Please understand that if you find success in Network Marketing, the industry of Multilevel Marketing cannot and should not take all of the credit for your success. And if you don't find the success you've been looking for in MLM then the industry of Network Marketing cannot bear all of the blame. If you are one of the few who find success in Network Marketing or in life, just know that you became the kind of person who could succeed and that is the way life is. Remember this very few people succeed in life at anything, Network Marketing isn't going to be any different. But the fact that only a few succeed shouldn't be a deterrent for you because champions don't measure themselves with statistical rulers. I learned in my early days of Network Marketing that ""Life will give you what you will fight for, or life will give you what you will accept"". That is a quote by Art Williams the founder of one of the great Network Marketing companies of all times. Go fight for what you want in MLM and you can have success! Much success to you in your MLM business."

1157,B00DF4SH0I,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DF4SH0I,"Invisible Money, Hidden Assets, Secret Accounts",4.99,"Invisible Money, Hidden Assets, Secret Accounts is based upon JJ Luna’s personal experiences over a long lifetime.  These date back to the early 1950s when he traveled constantly with a $500 or a $1,000 bill on his person. (Later, when the author moved to Spain’s Canary Islands in 1959, he sometimes handled real estate transactions via shopping bags and briefcases stuffed with cash.) Included are step-by-step instructions for hiding substantial amounts of money and other assets in your own home.  You will learn how to safely hide your money when you travel, and where to stash your cash in a hotel room. You’ll even learn how to transfer money across any border. Here are a few of the tips in the first chapter:Four Advantages of Making Routine Purchases with CashTemptation Avoidance. You’ll not make impulse purchases that you cannot afford. (It is much more difficult to make an “impulse” buy if you have to take cash out of your pocket to pay for it.) No monthly payments on loans, no credit card interest, and no overdraft fees from your bank. Lower prices. You’d be surprised at how much you can save by asking for a discount in return for paying with cash. For example, the next time a self-employed mechanic, plumber or electrician quotes you a price of, say, $1,200 plus sales tax, make a counter offer of $1,000 cash. More often than not, you’ll get that discount.Protection against identity theft. Obviously, if you don’t use a credit or debit card, you won’t be asked for a driver’s license that may (horror of horrors!) display your home address.Five Reasons to Keep Major Amounts of Cash on HandIf the banks shut down due to a power outage, terrorist attack, catastrophic computer malfunction or any other reason, you’ll be like the one-eyed man or woman in the kingdom of the blind.Cash is king.  If you spot the used car of your dreams at night or on a weekend, you’ll be able to beat out any other prospective buyers by offering cash on the spot.Should you be caught far from home when all airports shut down (as they did on 9/11), rent-a-car agencies will run out of vehicles in a flash. But with cash you can pay a taxi driver whatever it takes to get to your destination, or even buy a used car and get there on your own.If your ex- or current live-in lover turns against you (yes, Virginia, this has been known to happen), he or she won’t be able to go after your cash when there is no clue that it exists. Suppose you get a heads-up call from a friend at two o’clock in the morning, telling you that someone is out to get you. Time to get outta Dodge!  You grab your passport, all the cash you’ll need, laptop, cell phone, and hit the road! (Remove the cell phone’s battery, or else wrap it in aluminum foil that so it cannot be pinged.) Within the pages of  “Invisible Money” you will learn how to brace yourself against robberies, burglaries, scheming family members, frivolous lawsuits, unscrupulous creditors, crooked PIs, overzealous cops, or a sneak-and-peek by the F.B.I. If you carefully follow Luna’s detailed instructions, you’ll not longer worry about a levy or a freeze on your bank account.  You’ll be able to set up secret hiding places to hide your assets, carry cash with confidence when you travel, and even open a foreign bank account."

1159,B0064X5JHG,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0064X5JHG,Stopping Big Business and Politics From Bleeding America,5.87,"Fernando Pargas declares that America suffers from the corrupt alliance of business and politics. The money of the one and the power of the other make for an unstoppable force, he argues. Supporting that force, maintains Pargas, is their propaganda machine which convinces an uninformed and malleable public to follow them in what he calls ""hypnotic obedience.""“Stopping Big Business and Politics from Bleeding America: An Agenda for the New Generation” covers topics that Pargas says are too often ignored or misunderstood by the general public. His chapter topics include the business of war, the oil monarchy, and the influence of lobbying. Pargas, a former executive for Time Warner, Inc., was a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce International Council in Washington. D.C."

1164,B00GSLCM3I,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GSLCM3I,The Grand Scam: How Barry Tannenbaum Conned South Africa’s Business Elite,8.99,"From 2005 to 2009, the heir to one of South Africa’s blue-blood families, Barry Tannenbaum, methodically constructed the largest-ever con in South African history. The Grand Scam exposes details about the brazen greed of the scammers, a bank that facilitated the shady dealings rather than alerting the authorities, and the naivety of business people who should have known better. It goes far beyond the original news stories, containing original research and material that, for the first time, answers the central question of why. Barry Tannenbaum, the grandson of the founder of one of the country’s biggest pharmaceutical firms, Adcock Ingram, offered investors stratospheric returns of more than 200 per cent a year by investing in the components used to make AIDS drugs. It was nothing more than a lie, which suckered the country’s business elite, including the former CEO of Pick n Pay, the one-time head of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the ex-boss of OK Bazaars.     After the bubble popped in June 2009, finance minister Pravin Gordhan announced that hundreds of investors in South Africa, Australia and Europe had ploughed more than R12.5 billion into Tannenbaum’s scheme, based on the empty promise of immense riches. Dwarfing the Brett Kebble rip-off, Fidentia and the Krion pyramid scheme, it proved to be the most embarrassing financial disaster in the country’s history, and it exposed holes in a banking and financial system billed as one of the safest in the world.     For Tannenbaum’s victims, the nightmare continued after the scheme collapsed, as liquidators, tax officials and criminal investigators demanded their pound of flesh. But Tannenbaum, now at large on Australia’s Gold Coast, continues to live as if nothing happened, working for an Australian insurance company.     The question that hasn’t been answered until now is, how did Tannenbaum swindle so many people with such ease? And, more crucially, why did he do it? Through extensive interviews with his family, friends and numerous ‘investors’, this book provides the startling answers to those questions. For the first time, the real motivation that fuelled South Africa’s Bernie Madoff is laid bare."

1168,B007ZEIHYU,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ZEIHYU,The Ultimate Guide to Investing in Penny Stocks,2.99,"The odds are stacked against you on Wall Street. After all, when you open your Ameritrade account with a deposit of a few thousand dollars, you’re competing against multi-billion dollar hedge funds, foreign investment banks, and big institutions like pension funds, all staffed by hundreds or even thousands of MBAs and PhDs. These professionals work literally around the clock, spending millions of man-hours every year, just to make a fraction of 1% on any given trade. They have years of experience, proprietary statistical models, and—most importantly—access to inside information. Can you beat them? Sure, it’s possible—but for most traders, it isn’t likely… Unless you choose to trade stocks where mammoth size is a detriment, not an advantage: The world of penny stocks!Of course the “Wall Street industrial complex” wants us to believe penny stocks are a “sucker’s market”—they need us to buy stocks listed on the NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ through their overpriced brokers. They need us to pay their big institutional firms to manage our money. The mainstream financial media (CNBC, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, etc.) are dependent upon these exchanges, brokers, and institutions for advertising revenue, so they’re more than happy to conduct the propaganda campaign against penny stocks. It only makes sense.Now the truth is that, yes, there are some scam artists pushing penny stocks to gullible novices who want to “get rich quick.” But this is true of every market everywhere since the dawn of mankind. Fools and money quickly part, and that’s just as true of the penny-stock market as anywhere else—but you’re not a fool are you? It’s fairly easy to see through penny-stock scams, which this book goes into great detail about, but if you’re smart enough to know that anything “too-good-to-be-true” is too good to be true, and you’re willing to invest the necessary time and energy, then there isn’t a better investment class in the world than penny stocks."
