While there are many factors that go into a person deciding to purchase a book, such as word of mouth recommendations, cover art, and notability of the author, we want to focus on book jacket descriptions in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose someone is in a bookstore browing books or surfing through Amazon. They read the book jacket description to get a feel for what the contents of the book will be, any critical acclaim of the author, and perhaps, in the case of Business & Money books for example, how the book might impact the reader's daily livelihood.\n",

    "\n",
    "While we don't have sales information to work with (sales ranking was not a reliable information source), we do have rating information on a five star scale. Ratings and sales do share their own relationship, as people tend not to buy products that are rated poorly. However, it might also make sense that poorly writen books that recieve poor reviews also have poorly written book jacket descriptions, and vice versa.\n",

    "So operationally, let's set our first goal at predicting five-star rating using book jacket text.\n",

    "All three of these classifiers look like they performed decently well too! \n",

    "\n",
    "In theory, a nearest neighbors shouldn't work too well for this project because the training examples are very sparse. Both knn classifiers are trying to match a book to their most similar competitors and rank it based on that which is a decent approach. We also see that both knn classifiers are using multiple neighbors in an attempt to reduce noise. We can see that this is a limited approach because given the small number of examples we have it is unlikely that there are multiple books that discuss the same topics. As we saw from preliminary exploration, the books in the `Business & Money` category range from personal finance advice to social media marketing to how to self-publish a book. These topics are very numerous and so our examples are quite sparse. We would need to have many thousands of examples to work with, and even then we are still not guaranteed to have enough examples to allow for substantial similarity between an example and its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knn classifier might be improved by increasing the amount of training data or preprocessing the training and dev data to ensure examples are less sparse in the space of all possible examples. For example, a nearest neighbors classifier might be best suited for the Reference category, for example comparing very similar mathematics textbooks on the same subject, as a dataset like that would be relatively dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we know that Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression both use the same \"hypthesis space\", but operate with different loss functions. Naive Bayes considers marginal likelihoods in addition to conditional likelihoods, where as logistic regression considers just conditional likelihood and therefore does not know joint density. This means that Naive Bayes probably works best here, even though there is relatively little training data. Logistic regression is more likely to be overfit. In the `Many` dataset, we see that Multinomial Bayes outperforms Logistic Regression. In the `Few` dataset it is the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, it appears that the `Many` dataset performed better than the `Few` datset. This indicated that having many examples is more important than many individual ratings weighing into the average rating. All in all, the `Many` dataset paired with the Multinomial Bayes classifier gave the best performance. \n",

      "Sustainable competitive advantage no longer arises exclusively from position, scale, and the ability to produce and deliver an offering. Advantage today is far less durable than it was in the past�and leadership more transitory. In this environment, achieving, sustaining, and extending a competitive edge require extraordinary agility. Five-year plans must give way to rapid-cycle learning and action. Traditional strategy must become adaptive strategy. This book brings together a series of essays describing the results of ongoing research, by the Strategy Institute of The Boston Consulting Group, into how companies can sharpen their edge by accelerating the clock speeds of their strategies to match those of their markets. \n",

    "When applied to the test set, this combination gives an accuracy of 54%... which is not great. Given three possible classes, this is definitely better than randomly selecting a class. But it still leaves a lot to be desired and I don't think I would trust it to pick a book for me."

    "First, scrape a lot more data and be certain of its reliability. This experiment was very limited by the amount of data, at only 1000 examples. Increasing this to multiple thousands might make a large difference, as we saw with how 1000 examples was much more successful than 300 examples.\n",

    "Second, retry the experiment with some other categories of books, for example `History`, `Politics & Social Sciences`, or `Computers & Technology`. These are categories similar to `Business & Money` in that they are fact base whil still maintaining subjectivity. It would be interesting to see how these categories compare. Additionally, restricting within these categories, for example to specifically `Marketing` books withing `Business & Money` might help create a denser dataset, relatively. Furthermore, retry with experiment with `Reference`, a very factual category, or with `Literature & Fiction`, a very non-factual category, just to see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it would be interesting to look further into \"success\" than simply average star rating. This could include performing a sentimate analysis or keyword search on written reviews. Additionally, sales information such as relative ranking, copies sold, or gross revenue, could help make a more rounded definition of book succeess."
